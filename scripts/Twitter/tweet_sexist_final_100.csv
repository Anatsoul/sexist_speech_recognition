3711,_Mekondjo,I'm not ignoring the 2. I am not just highlighting them because I am okay with them because there is no legality to fatherhood attached.

3712,_Mekondjo,Every legal document is paper or plastic. We can't undermine what it represents just because it's a paper. Remember the paper is not what is important. It's the contents.

3713,_Mekondjo,My focus is on the full birth certificate - that's a sign of a registered legal father. Why are you avoiding things you put in your tweet? Nobody said anything about belief.

8287,x1tuS__der,@vitormariz @L3llipop @LiquipediaVAL i will. Emea challangers has more quality than masters anyway.
8288,x1tuS__der,"@KAZZ_693 @LiquipediaVAL And kr√º were playing shitty anyways.If they had faced acend in first match of playoffs they would get whooped. So,stop malding."

9762,ZrozaRkraD,"@PolarisTheNorth I get what you are saying though, obviously it's because they do not think women should be in combat but some of that has changed the past several years 

it is kind of rooted in biology, I know it sounds really stupid but body odors and things like that and sexual stuff"
9763,ZrozaRkraD,"@PolarisTheNorth I know

I think mostly from WW1 and WW2 then Vietnam

but maybe slightly sus they suddenly have started caring again after 50 years given everything going on rn"

That was like in 2016"
9772,ZrozaRkraD,"but then you start to realize that the F-22 has been in development since the 80s

But that the F-15 and F-16, which still BOTH get constant upgrades, started in the 60s

so why compared a less than 20 year old aircraft to aircraft that are nearly 60 years old"
9773,ZrozaRkraD,"but like... it's only really been in developing the past 15+ years, and not even really operational until the past 5 years or so... which seems like a really long time but again, barely ever actually used compared to other aircraft"
9774,ZrozaRkraD,"there is also the problem of needing to use stuff in real-world situations. I remember F-35 discourse and how much people hate it but it's actually a really cool jet (all three versions) especially with AI stuff, drone integration and lots of new tech"

9776,ZrozaRkraD,"from the outside looking in, it looks like we're just wasting time and money

but if you don't do this stuff then you just end up like Russia right now with actual wasted money because half your stuff just doesn't work"
9777,ZrozaRkraD,"all peacetime stuff our military does is literally just daily training and preparation 

there is a reason we constantly fly, use almost every vehicle and all of equipment, constantly have exercises, constantly use everything and look at everything"

So obviously it depends on the cost of schooling but that's max potential of... $212k

even more if you're in a more expensive state 

That's a decent amount for completing one term of enlistment"
9833,ZrozaRkraD,"plus you might get housing allowance, which for me would have been like $2200 a month lol

so that'd have been, for me, up to $27k a year for housing and supplies + $26k in tuition 

so assume a 4 year plan

that's almost $134k lol"

9903,ZrozaRkraD,you are told that all of these things are beautiful and pretty and attractive so that the companies can sell you all of their products and make you feel bad about your self-image and attack others over their self-image so they can further spread their brand poisons
9904,ZrozaRkraD,"I have always seen women as really beautiful in their natural state. I think a lot of men, and even women, are conditioned to think that a lot of the crap they see on TV and the internet is real life and they don't know what a real woman looks like"

9907,ZrozaRkraD,"I think it's more natural and sexy to have hair on your arms, other places, things like that. Skin so-called ""defects"" are also beautiful. Scars. Freckles. Moles. Acne. Sun spots. Etc.

The fact that we've see things as ""ugly"" is purely media bullshit"
9908,ZrozaRkraD,"image of what humans should look like, anyway"
9909,ZrozaRkraD,I don't even understand why OP makes the correlation with children because what did humans do before any of this dumb shit existed? Society has conditioned itself to form sexual attractions to so many things that it's unreal how far we have fallen from nature and God's image.
9910,ZrozaRkraD,"I think people forget that human beings are... animals. Sexual attraction, in nature, is of the pure, natural, unmodified state. Animals do not wear clothes. They do not modify their appearance unless they already have the NATURAL ability to do so, they do not wear accessories"
9911,ZrozaRkraD,this has been probably been going on for over a century but I think it has been heavily ramped up in recent times due to the ease of being able to manipulate everyone's self-image
9912,ZrozaRkraD,"If you are to look at human history pre-media influence, people were more natural and were attracted to one another in the nude. Sure, cosmetics and things existed but the natural state was the purest form of sexual attraction."
9913,ZrozaRkraD,"You are classically conditioned, really from the time you are born, to to find all these different things sexually attractive via product placement in movies, TV, magazines, advertisements, pornography, internet content, etc."
9914,ZrozaRkraD,All of that stuff is... get this... UNNATURAL! It's man-made. Artificial. You literally have a Pavlovian response to associate sexual attraction with all of those things. It's unnatural... and what does unnatural mean... NOT NORMAL. Abnormal. Weird.
9915,ZrozaRkraD,"My Sister in Christ, natural women are... natural, so it's... literally human NATURE to be NATURALLY attracted to a person in their NATURAL biological state

The cosmetic surgeries, the implants, the clothing, the makeup, the accessories... literally psychological conditioning! https://t.co/5pvk2SPWig"

9932,ZrozaRkraD,and everything is uploading super fast so I might as well just do everything I can
9933,ZrozaRkraD,Luckily hindsight to name the files appropriately (for the most part) which should make it easier for some to find what they are looking for. I have some videos. I might as well just upload everything I have. I have 100+ GBs on my main Google Drive and 15 on my other one.

9936,ZrozaRkraD,"but I'd think anyway, all my Ghost stuff would have been on HDDs that are over 10 1/2 years old (yes it has been that long, strange to think of)"
9937,ZrozaRkraD,"again for like 14 months so who knows how long they were like that, then I was back in Korea for 2 years and they sat in a box in my closet. I didn't even check them til like several months ago and pretty much every single one didn't work or did the clicking thing"
9938,ZrozaRkraD,"What probably killed them (and ruined a lot of other stuff I had/still have) was sitting in a storage unit in Okinawa for like a year or so while I was in Korea, then again on a ship for months... SO much of my stuff was covered in black mold and wet from the moisture"
9939,ZrozaRkraD,"sitting in boxes for years, moving back and forth between three different countries, sitting in shipping containers on a ship for months at sea, not good for these things"
9940,ZrozaRkraD,The only reason I don't have video copies is because the original videos are all made in like 2011 - 2012 aka when actual hard drives were more the standard rather than SSDs. Of course I saved all of these but they are like ALL dead. The only ones that weren't had no TCR stuff.
9941,ZrozaRkraD,"but I don't condone this

if u are going to reupload my stuff then u do it in the original format, UNCENSORED 

Have some respect for the dead!!! (me and Ghost, aka the same people) https://t.co/wyss3SSIHo"
9942,ZrozaRkraD,"and then some... like entire 3 hour BTR rips, some stuff I probably never uploaded, stuff that's been deleted or DMCA'd

I can upload all of that to Google Drive or something"
9943,ZrozaRkraD,"maybe slightly irrational decision but rational thinking is not something I've been doing lately

but yeah I also honestly wanted to distance myself from the actual content forever ago, like years and years ago

I don't have any videos but I have pretty much all the audio files"

9957,ZrozaRkraD,"@B0TFLY first humans on earth when literally none of this stuff existed but most mental illnesses have ALWAYS existed just taken time to document or redefine 

transgenderism is documented in very ancient times and most surely has existed for tens of thousands of years"
9958,ZrozaRkraD,"@B0TFLY sex is biological and gender arguably doesn't exist... if gender dysphoria is what it is supposed to be, it should be purely mental not physical and go back to the literal first human beings on earth 

That is body dysmorphia and can happen regardless of gender identity"
9959,ZrozaRkraD,"@B0TFLY but really my point is, no clothing or external accessory, cosmetics, etc is possibly gendered or sex-based

just like blue and pink have not always been boy and girl

it's purely social standard that changes all the time

look as recently as the 80s lol"
9960,ZrozaRkraD,"@B0TFLY Makeup has def been worn by men always but I guess it depends on what you define a dress as, because dresses came from tunics as you said, but some are extremely similar in what you're define as maybe a couture, tapered dress (ig when I think most basic definition of a dress)"
9961,ZrozaRkraD,"@B0TFLY even like wigs and longer hairstyles and things?? All originally for men lol. If I'm to believe it's not actually just a fetish or some kinda mental illness then what did being tr*ns look like a few hundred years ago, a thousand years ago, surely gender dysphoria existed then??"
9962,ZrozaRkraD,"@B0TFLY yeah but it's like... why do they ALL seemingly have that exact description of the caricature of what women are 

I just wonder where it all comes from, especially because if you even go back through history... heels, dresses, makeup originally worn by... men, not women."
9963,ZrozaRkraD,"@B0TFLY my biggest problem with it is the fact that they define women as just being long hair, boobs, makeup, a dress and heels

how is that NOT sexist and to a further extent ‚Äî extremely perverted

also why are so many of them ""lesbian"" it just makes you further question their motives"

10065,ZrozaRkraD,"not to speak for her but I think Mercy does the same thing, she has that good sense of right and wrong and she has a really good moral compass, I think, and she always does the right thing and does good things despite opposition or obstacles"

10067,ZrozaRkraD,@B0TFLY but like I respect it if people like it I just prefer hand-drawn stuff or digital art not AI-generated art which I assume is basically what they are
10068,ZrozaRkraD,"@B0TFLY idk, like I Google picrew and see stuff like this, I don't like it personally, the only cute one is the blue hair one and the one next to it I guess but the rest are cringe and ugly 

Especially like these ones in the second pic, hate it so much, I'm sorry lol https://t.co/N2kDS8DGYM"
10069,ZrozaRkraD,"or if you were beaten or abused in other ways, do not act the same way towards your children. Do not act the same way towards others. If people were mean to you, do not return that meanness. An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind."
10070,ZrozaRkraD,"do better than them. Don't repeat their mistakes and don't use the justification that ""this happened to me so I'm going to do it to you"" and I think that applies to CSA and stuff like just because you were molested as a child doesn't mean you should in turn abuse children."
10071,ZrozaRkraD,"I remember in leadership school my first shirt said being a supervisor was like being a parent. Remember all the shitty things they did to you and how they treated you badly and strive to do the better thing. Like all the shitty supervisors I had, the way they mistreated me"
10072,ZrozaRkraD,"@B0TFLY personally, in my opinion, I can't look at them favorably lol... they are very ugly 

I put them in the category of things I do not like looking at 

like furry art for example 

invokes a negative reaction

sorry if this offends anyone lol"
10073,ZrozaRkraD,my mentality not just with CSA and abuse in general but also just people being shitty to you and doing bad things to you throughout your life is to strive to be the better person and not do those things yourself
10074,ZrozaRkraD,"but they must understand it's not their fault 

it is not your fault that someone hurt you when you were a child

it is not your fault that someone made you do things that you weren't supposed to do"
10075,ZrozaRkraD,"I think a lot of cases of people doing things that are questionable might be a form of trauma response and a coping mechanism

however some people cannot deal and end up living in guilt/shame, end up hurting themselves, or redacting themselves"
10076,ZrozaRkraD,"granted, if you are able to reasonably cope with your trauma you probably avoid harming others or doing non-consenual acts"
10077,ZrozaRkraD,I think this also affects how people view sexual attraction for the rest of their lives... if you were a victim of CSA and exposure to things you should have not been exposed to as a child it forms your sexual attraction tendencies as an adult
10078,ZrozaRkraD,"I'm actually pretty sure that happens quite a lot, it just doesn't get reported. I think that's why a lot of sexuality issues develop with people, because as a child they were molested or had sexual contact with someone of the same sex, peers or adults, they think it's okay"
10079,ZrozaRkraD,"Women can do whatever they want when it comes to sexually abuse, especially with children

always a slap on the wrist

I think this is because people view young boys as ""asking for it"" or ""wanting it"", the law also doesn't seem to mind when a woman molests a young girl, kinda sus https://t.co/QgCHKXs8bf"
10080,ZrozaRkraD,"I mean the concept of actually organizing it and doing it with a group of people to mess with someone is the autistic thing not the people who think they're being gangstalked

10091,ZrozaRkraD,"and I think it's okay to be like ""I don't think that looks good on you"" but that's just your opinion and that's okay to have opinions I don't think it means that you're trying to be mean or anything you're just expressing your personal tastes"
10092,ZrozaRkraD,"I think it is okay to offer opinions on what you think looks good or doesn't look good but you have to do it in a way that's not hurtful. You know, like hey that shirt looks cool or whatever is fine but not ""that shirt is so ugly"""
10093,ZrozaRkraD,bullying people for their appearance does nothing but break them down and hurts their self-esteem and makes them feel bad and chips away at their self-confidence
10094,ZrozaRkraD,"they're trying to control you and make you feel bad, to what end, I don't know, it's just pure evil"
10095,ZrozaRkraD,anyone saying you're ugly or trying to say you need to do your makeup a certain way or get certain surgeries or use certain products are just trying to bully you because they hate you and they want you to be submissive to them and they have you under their spell basically
10096,ZrozaRkraD,"when in reality any man or woman finds you totally beautiful just the way you are without any makeup or filters 

natural beauty is the ultimate beauty"
10097,ZrozaRkraD,they want you to feel bad about yourself and feel insecure so you buy their products and their makeup and buy their surgeries and follow their beauty standards so they can make more money and hoard wealth
10098,ZrozaRkraD,I feel like if you look in the mirror and you see acne/scratch/stretch marks/wrinkles/freckles/moles and you feel gross/ashamed/disgusted it's because the media and social media and elites and models and celebrities and Hollywood and so on make you feel that way
10099,ZrozaRkraD,"This is why I encourage Mercy to never wear makeup because she looks beautiful just the way she is with marks and stuff and it's okay

every wrinkle and mark and stuff is beautiful"
10100,ZrozaRkraD,"also cosmetic surgery... acne, scars, burns, marks, freckles, etc. are beautiful &amp; you should not be ashamed of that stuff because it tells a story in some sense but it's also just your biology - it will sort itself out over time &amp; you should be comfortable with your appearance"
10101,ZrozaRkraD,"I understand if you get a tattoo because it really means something to you, if you are marking yourself, as symbolism for something, for example wedding tattoos on your finger, but it should not be to cover up scars or because you are image-obsessed"
10102,ZrozaRkraD,"My only problem with tattoos, piercings, cosmetic surgery, intentionally damaging your body in any way (self-harm, plastic surgery) and also things like contact lenses and wigs is you're saying the way God made you isn't good enough and you want to change it"

I don't think supporting a celebrity is the equivalent to supporting their decisions s/actions"

10106,ZrozaRkraD,If anyone wants to make this all into a movie or a book you owe me royalties
10107,ZrozaRkraD,and this causes WW3 in the natural world and that's the solution instead of having a rapture or whatever and it is explained to humans that WW1 and WW2 in the natural world/existence are basically the result of conflict between Heaven and Hell
10108,ZrozaRkraD,"like you can't have a total utopia nor can you have a total post-apocalyptic wasteland because both of those things suck and nothing cool or interesting happens in those scenarios because society can't advance forward

but, all of this is happening in Heaven (the marriage stuff)"
10109,ZrozaRkraD,This is what basically converts Satan into a nicer guy who starts leaving people alone but we all accept we need a little chaos and things in the natural world in order for it to function normally
10110,ZrozaRkraD,"and that's their whole gimmick really is just pushing limits to make people mad with the further goal of just trying to get people accept one another for who they are 

all of this is happening in heaven and they all have the protection of God and Satan"
10111,ZrozaRkraD,They're all in one big polycule but like they're the first polycule of Actually Attractive People and they all get along and have fun and don't care what anyone thinks and this just further makes everyone mad
10112,ZrozaRkraD,"but she gets married to Jesus but doesn't believe in homosexuality because of her religious beliefs however Mary doesn't care &amp; neither does the anti-christ/daughter of Satan girl, there's no jealousy &amp; Mary has her own wife anyway that doesn't have anything to do with Jesus"
10113,ZrozaRkraD,"but just to make things even more chaotic and to further piss people off, there is a second coming of Mohammed in the form of a woman &amp; she's like kinda interested in Jesus &amp; doesn't care what the Quran says"
10114,ZrozaRkraD,it's the first polygamist wedding officiated under both God and Satan and the atheists are super mad and so are the scientologists because they're all losers and the satanists are like man this is fucking stupid and the christ-based religions are super mad
10115,ZrozaRkraD,"so like you have Jesus, Mary and the daughter of Satan and they all get married and live happily ever after and it causes world peace and Satan and God are both at the wedding 

It's broadcast to the natural world, to Hell and to Heaven and it makes everyone super uncomfortable"
10116,ZrozaRkraD,"in the world* and 

it's a polyamorous relationship just to piss off everyone even further but also to teach lessons about acceptance"
10117,ZrozaRkraD,also Romeo and Juliet type vibes with warring families and stuff except nobody dies and there's a happy ending also there's a Mary-like character except she's the most wholesome girl and the world and spreads the truest form of feminism
10118,ZrozaRkraD,she's like a new character and the second coming of Jesus is also a new character not the original Jesus and their marriage is like the bridged gap between good and evil and gets God and Satan to accept that they're just really old dudes who need to calm down and let humans live
10119,ZrozaRkraD,"God &amp; Satan are like so confused by this that Heaven &amp; Hell agree to stop fighting &amp; the world returns to normal. Satan is like damn maybe I need to be nicer &amp; stop being so mean all the time if these two can literally fall in love 

then it turns into a cheesy love story"
10120,ZrozaRkraD,"Rewriting the Bible to where there's a second coming of Jesus but the anti-christ is the daughter of Satan but instead of killing the anti-christ, they fall in love and get married and the anti-christ accepts God and Jesus and Satan is like wow okay whatever"

10123,ZrozaRkraD,"Man, this issue is really what humanity is going to be focusing on/shoving down our throats for years to come

why can't everyone just go back to being normal/stop trying to force people to be accepting of things they are not comfortable with or doing things they don't want to do https://t.co/fljR3m20mV"

10130,ZrozaRkraD,"But the idea of falling in love with or finding some silent hill monster-like woman beautiful is nothing new for me

kinda had a crush on those bubble head nurses when I was a teen

just something I can remember having weird thoughts about for a while"
10131,ZrozaRkraD,"Which I think I've described what that means before lol, don't mean to always be repeating myself"
10132,ZrozaRkraD,"my dreams are weird sometimes 

when I say ""themes of x,y,z"" when describing dreams I just mean those are literally themes or elements of what's going on that I'm supposed to just be aware of as if I've read a program pamphlet for an event beforehand or a list of story elements"
10133,ZrozaRkraD,"but also themes of torture, abandonment and self-image concerns and insecurities

but it's like you were rotting away in my water heater, don't be so hard on yourself just maybe don't look in the mirror for quite a while and trust when I say you're beautiful lol"
10134,ZrozaRkraD,"it was very odd

but again despite looking like some silent hill abomination she was very oddly pretty, beautiful, felt a warm feeling of love and I can tell she was grateful to be saved and free of her torture but on a long road to recovery"
10135,ZrozaRkraD,"Somehow still alive anyway, should be dead

but something oddly beautiful about her so I very gently grab her and help her out and I hold her and tell her she's really beautiful and that I'm here to save her and that she's gonna be okay"
10136,ZrozaRkraD,"But anyway in the dream, I eventually give in to what I think are just weird delusions and somehow get my water heater open and sure enough there is some woman in there. Looking like a silent hill creature and decaying and gross and disgusting like a corpse but still alive"
10137,ZrozaRkraD,So I largely ignored it all. Couldn't hear what was being said anyway but just had a feeling there was something weird (plus IRL it makes loud noises a lot and I do have weird heating issues from time to time so maybe this subconsciously affected my dreams)
10138,ZrozaRkraD,"I had this really weird dream where this girl had been trapped in my water cooler the whole time, living off of hot water and like bugs for who knows how long. Been trying to communicate with me forever somehow through the vents but I thought I was going crazy, hearing voices"

10141,ZrozaRkraD,I wish my life could just be normal but I know I'll never get that and I honestly just wish Mercy could have a better life because I know everything is stressful for her and I feel like such a burden and hopeless lately
10142,ZrozaRkraD,"I wish people would appreciate everything Mercy does because she does quite a lot, she is strong when I cannot be and I am forever grateful for that

I don't think I could have made it this far in life without her especially not the past couple years lol"
10143,ZrozaRkraD,"I suppose I could just pay other people to move things for me but then that's just more money wasted that I don't have

it all sucks but I'll figure it out

we're trying our best but it really does feel all out of my control"
10144,ZrozaRkraD,but also like I just feel consistently weaker and weaker every day it makes it really hard to do anything or to clean or do my tasks and like it's gonna suck having to move because I have such an incredibly hard time doing stuff like that now
10145,ZrozaRkraD,"I'm just tired of feeling so sick all the time and I don't trust any of the healthcare here so I dunno, I will just have to wait until things work out how I want them to then I will see what I can do"
10146,ZrozaRkraD,"it should not be controversial to state that you should be allowed to consume literally anything and everything besides another human being or a living creature but also that you should literally never be forced to consume or have anything injected, touch you, etc whatsoever"

10150,ZrozaRkraD,"here's the deal

freedom is worth more than anything ever

I will always believe that 

being involuntary admitted for treatments for things not asked for instead of getting help specifically asked for/being left alone is a direct violation of freedom"

10152,ZrozaRkraD,"I think maybe I should try fasting and minimal fluid intake for a few days idk

the thing is I don't even weigh that much I am very thin despite how much I am consuming, it's very strange"
10153,ZrozaRkraD,"also feel very sickly lately, like very very ill in a way I can't describe, very weak, very tired, no strength, this is despite eating healthy and drinking a lot of fluids

but especially the feeling weird drinking water thing is bothering me"
10154,ZrozaRkraD,My sense of smell is all weird because of COVID but getting progressively worse and making it hard to eat or drink things I usually am fine but earlier I tried to drink some water and it kinda smelled like dog food and this was from a fresh filter and everything so idk

10192,ZrozaRkraD,You should be able to research other cultures and understand how and why they do the things they do and be okay with it or at least comfortable with it and not try to impose yourself upon others
10193,ZrozaRkraD,if you are so easily offended by simple words then you will never be able to interact with other cultures which is why tribalism is incredibly stupid &amp; dangerous for society but also globalism &amp; centralization is stupid because everyone is different &amp; all cultures are different
10194,ZrozaRkraD,"Also just need to respect the fact that people grew up in different cultural backgrounds and work different occupations or have different educations and they will have all sorts of different rules and things that come with using slang, jargon, swear words, so forth"
10195,ZrozaRkraD,"Words themselves should not have any power whatsoever but with proper context, tone, control, volume, pitch, purpose, reason, etc. they can have a sense of command but you don't get to that level of command without being comfortable using words and language casually"
10196,ZrozaRkraD,"Because if you have a shock response or are taken-aback by words you're impairing your ability to reason and think critically, in the moment, you're letting yourself get upset and confused and uncomfortable"
10197,ZrozaRkraD,"And it would make sense, you should be able to speak with confidence and I'm sure the way your brain processes swear words and so-called ""foul"" language is critical to your cognitive reasoning skills processes and how you are able to interpret things but also convey speech/ideas"
10198,ZrozaRkraD,"there are a lot of studies that suggest that swearing a whole bunch in casual conversation, being able to control how you speak depending on who's around/who's listening &amp; your environment is a sign of greater intelligence than the average person &amp; cognitive/reasoning skills"

10219,ZrozaRkraD,@panda_gongjunim also walking is like the easiest exercise that does wonders if you do a lot of it. It might feel goofy to pace around the house or dance around but if you're by yourself nobody's gonna judge lol
10220,ZrozaRkraD,"@panda_gongjunim what might help and what I have suggested to others and it seems to help... move around a lot when you can, when you're idle listen to music and dance along. Even just small, light dancing here and there burns so many calories at random without breaking a sweat too much"
10221,ZrozaRkraD,"@panda_gongjunim rather, I always find when it comes to this stuff it's a mental struggle because it's easy to be down on yourself and feel bad about yourself and focusing on numbers just makes it harder... I know easier said than done lol"
10222,ZrozaRkraD,"@panda_gongjunim idk, I wouldn't pay too much mind to BMI if that's what you're going off of. I always find waist size and proportions to be more important but what's most important is how you feel and how you see yourself

10292,ZrozaRkraD,"and the reality is, as an adult you're just gonna come across a lot of rude people and people who say hurtful things or do mean things intentionally or unintentionally

how equipped you are to handle it again is entirely based on your life experiences"
10293,ZrozaRkraD,it's complicated to what degree what is acceptable and what is not. In the perfect world we'd all just be nice to each other and you'd never even have to worry about it but different experiences at different points in your life shape how you process things emotionally forever

10302,ZrozaRkraD,"All forms of pain are to teach you ""hey this thing fucking hurts maybe you shouldn't do it again or maybe you should be more careful when doing it"" and that totally extends to relationships

all relationships are an emotional investment, you know the risks, be careful

10303,ZrozaRkraD,"like even sometimes when you aren't ""dating"" someone but you love them and they don't return the same love or they stop talking to you or stop being your friend or do something hurtful or they disappear or die or whatever, it fucking hurts

10337,ZrozaRkraD,"Also, I think the entire concept of having a child to change your life or turn things around or give you some sense of motivation or responsibility is such a fucked up mindset to have

genuinely evil to think you need to create life in order to improve your own"
10338,ZrozaRkraD,"But like, we'll get there eventually, we'll be in a better position at some point, THEN we will have children

Not now"
10339,ZrozaRkraD,"I will not bring a human being into this world unless I can give it the best possible chance at having the best possible life

It's a human being, not a toy or a pet or an object 

I feel bad enough as it as for everything my cats have lived through lol"
10340,ZrozaRkraD,Really that's why I hate when people ask why we don't have kids yet. Have you seen my apartment? Have you seen my financial situation? Have you seen the state of my mental health? Have you seen the state of the world we live in? Would you want to be raised in those conditions?
10341,ZrozaRkraD,"But that's why I really want the conditions and environment to be perfect for when we do have a child so I can raise them the best possible way, in the safest and cleanest home, with the most resources possible, with the most support possible, with the most attention possible"
10342,ZrozaRkraD,I think if/when I have my own children it will not be weird or uncomfortable but with children I do not know or even children within my own family it's just really hard for me because I don't want to do or say the wrong thing and ruin their life or something lol
10343,ZrozaRkraD,"But when I say talk to children as you would an adult I mean in regards to tone of voice to make them feel like they're understood or listened to

not in terms of topics"
10344,ZrozaRkraD,"whereas teenagers and adults are better equipped to handle trauma and weird and new information and adults especially, you don't have to be so careful"
10345,ZrozaRkraD,"solely based on words or actions alone, even single words and actions can have heavy impact on a child for their entire life"
10346,ZrozaRkraD,"have free range of the internet and YouTube and like that's especially bad

but that's why I feel so uncomfortable around children because it feels like a heavy responsibility, a heavy burden like I could literally shape their life forever for worse or for better"
10347,ZrozaRkraD,"I think of my own childhood and everything I saw that I shouldn't have and how it has permanently affected me to this day

then I think about the things people do around their children, the things I've seen, how people act and behave, or how they'll just let their children"
10348,ZrozaRkraD,They don't think that way. They will just be weird and creepy and smoke and drink and watch weird shit on TV or have the weirdest conversations around their kids and it's like do you not understand what you are doing to them mentally?
10349,ZrozaRkraD,"But also children are sponges and anything you say and do will greatly influence and impact them in many ways as opposed to someone who is much older so you have to walk on eggshells and be extremely careful with what you do and say around children 

And I think many people don't"
10350,ZrozaRkraD,"But anyway, when I know someone is a child and I can sense that someone is a child (if that makes sense) I feel a heavy responsibility to not want to hurt their feelings, or say anything inappropriate, or say the wrong thing because their parents might get upset"
10351,ZrozaRkraD,"women especially tend to look more child-like 

But on the other hand I have met actually like 10 - 13 year olds who tower over me, have more defined features than either Mercy or I, which is again why I think it's heavily a generational thing, but I digress"
10352,ZrozaRkraD,"babies and infants are obvious but beyond that what are features that even define what a child is because I have worked with so many people who look like literally 10 year olds but are older than me, people who are like 4'10"" lol but in their 20s/30s"
10353,ZrozaRkraD,"Visually, it's hard to define what a child is... I feel like you can just ""sense"" that someone is a child, not by just looking at them because there are plenty of people of all ages who share physical characteristics and features with children of that age range."
10354,ZrozaRkraD,"When I think of what a child is, I think of ages like 5 - 11 or 12 depending, obviously there is no magical switch that gets flipped on your birthday that changes who are with each passing year but we can generalize around that age range

Below 5 are infants and babies"
10355,ZrozaRkraD,"I have a hard time dealing with children

It's because I view them as:
- sensitive
- weak
- less intelligent
- less self-actualized
- fragile
- information sponges

Which sounds rude &amp; dehumanizing on a surface level but you have to bear with me &amp; let me finish this thought lol"
10356,ZrozaRkraD,@PolarisTheNorth but dealing with children you don't want to hurt their feelings or say anything mean or wrong to them but at the same time I was always raised to speak to children as you would an adult so they can learn to interact with the real world... sans foul language or certain topics
10357,ZrozaRkraD,@PolarisTheNorth Like I felt like I was gonna drop the babies or mishandle them or hurt them and I didn't want that responsibility I guess
10358,ZrozaRkraD,@PolarisTheNorth Like I've held babies before and stuff and I still felt uncomfortable and I've worked with children before and I try my best to be like what I think you're supposed to be like I used to volunteer at elementary schools on base at Kadena and Osan
10359,ZrozaRkraD,"@PolarisTheNorth Or when I look at a baby I'm not like ""that's a cute baby"" 

lots of babies are ugly! Weird looking! It's just me, it's just how I am, what's wrong with that?? Plenty of people are like this so people can't tell me it's not ""normal"""
10360,ZrozaRkraD,@PolarisTheNorth like for me personally I think kids are annoying and I feel uncomfortable being around children especially younger children and it makes me feel weird and awkward like I don't know how to talk to them or interact with them and I don't see why that's a problem
10361,ZrozaRkraD,"@PolarisTheNorth I think people are like ""I have kids and I love them and it's fun raising kids and I love teaching children and playing with them and raising them and it's rewarding and fulfilling"" and... cool, that's just your experience, it's not the same for everyone else"
10362,ZrozaRkraD,"@PolarisTheNorth people just want to control others but also live vicariously through others, it's very creepy and weird and I understand it to some extent it's like, being unable to why something feels good and right to you but not to others"

10368,ZrozaRkraD,"@DeadassFren @MKUltraGoth At least when we had the gold standard we had something to base the economy on, the amount of gold and it's value but at the end of the day, gold is just a piece of metal, it's garbage, it's worthless, it's an object that we pretend has value, just like diamonds"
10369,ZrozaRkraD,"@DeadassFren @MKUltraGoth When you are forced to play by the rules of the economy then money will help you get ahead and buy things and have security

but if we deem money to be worthless then you can't do anything

but trade things

free trade

things are only worth what people think they are worth"
10370,ZrozaRkraD,"@DeadassFren @MKUltraGoth but why does it matter in the grand scheme of things because again, money is worthless, fiat currency is just a symbolic representation of what people think it's worth, if people think money is worthless then it is,if people think money is valuable, then it is"
10371,ZrozaRkraD,"@DeadassFren @MKUltraGoth it's like intentionally watching them suffer for amusement if you give them food and drinks because what are you accomplishing other than keeping them alive another day to do the same thing

10372,ZrozaRkraD,"@DeadassFren @MKUltraGoth why give them food, why not just give them money

10389,ZrozaRkraD,"yeah it's a bit of a sensory overload but it's possible to process all of this simultaneously all while still being cognitively aware of the visual information beyond what you are reading, peripheral vision but also your subconscious is processing things actively"
10390,ZrozaRkraD,What about listening to music while reading while at the same time playing a song in your head that is different from the one playing in your ears AND someone is talking to you at the same time
10391,ZrozaRkraD,"people say they have no internal monologue... I'm not sure how that is true. What happens when you read text for example? When you read tweets?

What happens in your head if you're reading something while also saying something else entirely?"
10392,ZrozaRkraD,but breaking down how I dream helps me become more aware of how I think while consciously awake because there are similarities
10393,ZrozaRkraD,"If that makes any sense

In my dreams my thought process is the exact same on a basic level as it is when I am awake. I am aware of my internal monologue too but I don't have control over it."
10394,ZrozaRkraD,I think I tweeted about this dream before but it's stuck with me. I don't often remember my dreams but they are always incredibly vivid and my stream of consciousness that is no different than when I am awake is always still active
10395,ZrozaRkraD,"but at the same time, on a more conscious level, I'm like concerned with the monster looking creatures and why the colors are so creepy and washed out"
10396,ZrozaRkraD,"supposed to have seen, like only she possibly could have known that and I'm like trying to explain, no, you released these albums where I'm from and it's some thing we can't wrap our heads around

10397,ZrozaRkraD,"because I didn't know the songs or the lyrics but I did know folklore/evermore and her being kinda really mad that I did because she wanted to know how I knew her ""unreleased"" works but not her newest albums, like accusatory as if I broke into her home or saw something I wasn't"
10398,ZrozaRkraD,"Like the entire world was in some weird dark filter and very ugly and creepy looking which has nothing to do with the main point of the dream, which was these Taylor Swift albums and me meeting her in person, totally by chance, and her being disappointed"
10399,ZrozaRkraD,"And I was in high school again but it was like some creepy alternative reality version of my high school, very Silent Hill-esque with creepy monster looking creatures and the whole world in general was very bleak, dark, heavy black saturation and darker brown colors"
10400,ZrozaRkraD,Like I remember a dream I had months ago where there was some like alternate reality where folklore/evermore didn't exist but instead one or two similar albums with the same aesthetic album art and same style/musical themes
10401,ZrozaRkraD,At least I'm positive it's all stuff I've never seen and heard before but my mind will generate it like some kind of AI generated music/video thing
10402,ZrozaRkraD,"Sometimes I have dreams where there are Taylor Swift songs or albums that exist in some kind of alternate reality. Will hear entire songs I've never heard before, sometimes see music videos that don't exist in the real world"
10403,ZrozaRkraD,"On a societal level it doesn't matter. Petitions don't work, companies and elites will do literally whatever they want. Politicians will do whatever they want. Voting almost isn't even real and might as well just be something to make you feel like you have influence."
10404,ZrozaRkraD,"Realistically I often wonder if it even matters to ever argue about anything ever because the fact of the matter is, you will almost never change someone's opinion but beyond that, your opinion doesn't matter when it comes to changing laws or anything like that"

it doesn't matter what the topic is you can always find something to back up your beliefs"

10426,ZrozaRkraD,"@PolarisTheNorth it's just the matter of accepting people as they are and making them comfortable and letting them do what they want so long as it doesn't hurt anyone and it's consensual

it does not matter WHY you are the way you are, the reality is that you ARE the way you are"
10427,ZrozaRkraD,"my ultimate point here is that tone can be totally misinterpreted and you have no way knowing true intentions other than to just believe someone and it's further complicated when it's via text

10436,ZrozaRkraD,"context matters always and intention matters always and it's up to you to believe if the intention is good or not if the context provided is not clear enough or is absent

but you should not immediately associate words or phrases with positive or negative connotations"
10437,ZrozaRkraD,"And disability. The fact that ""retarded"" used to a valid medical term but then got associated with being wrong/stupid and it's almost the same way with how people say ""you're gay"" or ""you're mentality ill"" in a derogatory way because they carry diff meanings depending on context"
10438,ZrozaRkraD,Somebody saying something is not normal is not them saying you are bad or not good. Somebody saying something is normal is not them saying it is good. This is the big problem with mental health too.

10441,ZrozaRkraD,"@PolarisTheNorth If I were presenting these tweets in front an audience, many closed-minded individuals would read the phrase ""conversation therapy"" and immediately stop reading or listening without seeing the bigger picture. Immediately despise is to think ""bigot"" ""hate"" ""evil"" ""ugly"" so forth"
10442,ZrozaRkraD,"@PolarisTheNorth Also people don't want to be told that something about their identity is not ""normal"" or the product of conditioning or abuse, as you said, it's the implication"
10443,ZrozaRkraD,"@PolarisTheNorth yeah, see my tweet in response to this. Supported by abuse and environment. I think conversion therapy does not work, cannot work because of how it is done and the fact that sexuality becomes set in stone the older you get."
10444,ZrozaRkraD,"At least, I believe it is your right and it is a violation of your rights and freedoms for others to label you and tell you what you are.

For others to tell you what your identity is."
10445,ZrozaRkraD,"it is nobody's place to decide what your gender or sexuality is besides you yourself. Nobody else can label you, identify you or tell you what you are. Only you can tell yourself and others what you are."
10446,ZrozaRkraD,"There is nothing wrong with homosexuality and there is nothing wrong with transgenderism but there is everything wrong with others trying to force it upon others (parents, medical professionals and teachers telling children that they are gay, that they are transgender)"
10447,ZrozaRkraD,"gender dysphoria and body dysmorphia and identity struggles are clear indicators that it's a complex topic 

I do not think atypical sexuality is ""normal"", whatever ""normal"" means but it IS natural, in that, it is natural to be the product of your environment and background"
10448,ZrozaRkraD,"this is very much supported by the fact that the majority of homosexuals are products of abuse or inappropriate sexual exposure by the same gender/sex or media or experiences regarding the same gender/sex 

it's incredibly complicated"
10449,ZrozaRkraD,"super hot take but I there is a third stance on how sexuality works... people think you are either born gay or you choose to be gay

but nobody considers that you can just be conditioned to be gay, either intentionally or unintentionally (grooming IS real)"
10450,ZrozaRkraD,"But I think when you reach a certain age it's impossible to change... insofar I would say you absolutely can condition sexuality in a way. I don't think you can condition it out of them though, once they reach a certain age.

That is just how the human mind works."
10451,ZrozaRkraD,I don't think you can help what you are sexually attracted to. I don't think it can be changed. I think it can totally be conditioned though. You can force somebody to be sexually attracted to something via classical conditioning and brainwashing while they are children
10452,ZrozaRkraD,"But I also associate glasses with like the nerdy girl, the dorky girl, the really smart girl, which is also sexy to me, kinda hot, again why that is I do not know

and that's not to say I'm not attracted to women who don't wear glasses"
10453,ZrozaRkraD,"It's almost a sexual thing for me too sometimes, the glasses thing. All women, for me, are immediately hotter when they wear glasses. I don't know why that it, it just is. Again, it's just conditioning both by society and via conscious and subconscious observation"
10454,ZrozaRkraD,"Because I don't even know where the glasses thing comes from for me. Obviously tons of men wear glasses but I am not attracted to them, sometimes I think they look kinda fruity (insert dog picture)

I don't know why my mind immediately jumps to that"
10455,ZrozaRkraD,"We are not only conditioned by society to believe in gender, gender roles and associate sexual lust and desires with certain cosmetic features but we also just pick it through personal experience or through observation, often times subconsciously"
10456,ZrozaRkraD,I know gender is fake because I always associate glasses with femininity and women but I don't assume that biological men who wear glasses must be transgender women
10457,ZrozaRkraD,@PolarisTheNorth ur telling me a man can't wear a dress and still be a man???
10458,ZrozaRkraD,"""is this your mutual""

your mutuals are garbage because all they do is jerk you off and praise you, it's fake"
10459,ZrozaRkraD,"If I just cater my following and topics and social media and everything specifically to match everything I like and to find people who hate everything that I hate

what am I accomplishing really

it's fake 

it sucks"
10460,ZrozaRkraD,"like it's nice to have validation and people who share your interests and beliefs and stuff but you have to be willing to face the reality that the opposition exists and to not care 

and I think validation needs to be genuine"
10461,ZrozaRkraD,Echo chambers are not healthy. Surrounding yourself solely with people who agree with you while blocking everyone and muting everyone and ignoring everyone who doesn't will not help you much at all.
10462,ZrozaRkraD,"So*

but like, I think this is the fundamental problem with the social and political landscape in this country

we were fine and got along for the most part until this pandemic hit and everyone had too much time to just sit and stew in thoughts and form echo chambers"
10463,ZrozaRkraD,"Sso what if you love the color blue and I think it's total shit. I think it's cool you're so passionate about and love something I hate so much. I respect that, because at least you're honest and you don't stop loving/believing something just because of my opinion."
10464,ZrozaRkraD,"so long as you are not hurting anyone based on opinions or beliefs then there is nothing wrong with having thoughts and you can love, respect and care about someone who clashes with your thoughts and opinions in every way"
10465,ZrozaRkraD,your relationship is formed on the foundation beyond simple things like that and you find common ground and focus on the things you do have in common while recognizing and respecting you have differences and beliefs and opinions that may be polar opposites
10466,ZrozaRkraD,"are you the sum of beliefs and opinions or are you, as a person, beyond that

if someone loves you, I think, it does not matter if they hate anything you like or disagree with any of your beliefs or opinions

your bond is beyond that, your love is beyond that"
10467,ZrozaRkraD,"they should believe your intentions

if blue is your favorite color and you've dedicated your whole life to worshiping the color blue and we're madly in love and one day I say blue is the shittiest, ugliest color on the planet

why does that change anything about our relationship"
10468,ZrozaRkraD,"And like the thing is, if people can't get past the negative side of you, your negative beliefs, your opinions that clash with theirs, then what is anyone even accomplishing 

simple as

words hurt

but you know what hurts more

when people don't believe in you"
10469,ZrozaRkraD,"Therapy and counselors cost money and time you often don't have or cannot afford and if you're like me you assume they don't care because if they did it would be free and on your terms, not theirs, it wouldn't even be an occupation"
10470,ZrozaRkraD,of bottling emotions because nobody will see it. You don't want to burden your friends with negativity a lot of the time. Everyone needs validation from somewhere. We are social animals. We cannot exist by ourselves. With Twitter you can at least pretend people hear you
10471,ZrozaRkraD,"Everyone wants to be heard or believed. If you are in a relationship during times of stress and you are supposed to be the strong person, you don't want to burden someone with negativity 

Journals/diaries don't work for everyone, in my mind it might as well just be another form"
10472,ZrozaRkraD,"@frozenaesthetic it's funny to me, people will read you complaining and stuff and hating on things on Twitter and think ""wow, this person is really angry and bitter and blah blah blah"" and it's like, no, I'm really not, this is just my venting platform

what are my alternatives?"
10473,ZrozaRkraD,"@frozenaesthetic I think that's the biggest problem with Twitter

Everyone comes here looking for friendship while simultaneously using it as a platform to vent all of their frustrations

And the thing is, you CAN do both"

there is no possible way to prove if someone is lying or not unless you are God Himself"

but then to hear that it happens to her too about me

that sucks

how is that helping anyone"
10486,ZrozaRkraD,"It especially bothers me when people tell her that I do x, y, z and why it's wrong and blah blah blah or people tell me that she does stuff and why it's wrong

you are not us, stop telling us what is right and wrong, let us decide for ourselves"

10488,ZrozaRkraD,"if they say they are in love, then they are in love, there is no way to prove this &amp; you can't just tell them they're lying or they're immature/incapable of love or whatever (like the people saying Mercy &amp; I were incapable of loving one another because we were young when we met)"
10489,ZrozaRkraD,"I also hate when people try to tell other people that they are not in love 

you have no place to say that

it's not your right

only those people can know if they are in love"
10490,ZrozaRkraD,"Religion does not even matter at this point or laws or anything because nothing can stop you from loving someone

However, you have no right to demand someone love you

You have no right to expect love from someone

You have no right to try to force someone to love you"
10491,ZrozaRkraD,"But, ultimately, anyway, who cares what you do or who you decide to love or marry because you should have the right to love whoever you choose to love"
10492,ZrozaRkraD,"This is why I don't think sex before marriage is a sin if you truly love each other, you know you love each other and God knows. I also don't think polygamy or polyamory is wrong because if you all love each other mutually then that is marriage because love = marriage under God"
10493,ZrozaRkraD,"The entire concept of marriage as we know it is entirely man-made

The rings, the ceremonies, the traditions, the legal stuff, etc. is not true marriage it is just symbolism

Because marriage and love, as defined by the Bible, are abstract concepts and in God's eyes only"
10494,ZrozaRkraD,"born married essentially because you are bound by love because love is also God's doing, therefore, true mutual love between people and ""marriage"" are one in the same"
10495,ZrozaRkraD,If I am to take the Bible at face value then that means you are married before you even meet the person lol
10496,ZrozaRkraD,"I'm just endlessly musing and thinking of things 

This is why I think sex before marriage (as people think of it) is not a sin

because the entire concept of a legal marriage or a ceremonial marriage is not what the Bible says marriage is 

Marriage is done by God and God alone"
10497,ZrozaRkraD,"If I am to believe that marriage is between you, someone else and God and that God makes you love someone because you are meant to be together then divorce is not even a possibility to begin with 

Again just playing by the rules of the Bible"
10498,ZrozaRkraD,"I think the concept of a prenup is really stupid, because that implies you expect the possibility of things not working out, which means, again, you never loved them, and you can't fall out of love, so you got married for the wrong reasons (in my opinion but also the Bible)"
10499,ZrozaRkraD,"the only thing I can understand is when you have kids or pets and don't know what to do with them, I think the kids should decide in that case. Pets are complicated because they can't speak for themselves."
10500,ZrozaRkraD,placing so much value in money and material possessions just makes those things have control over you.
10501,ZrozaRkraD,"I do believe in unrequited love too, though, and one-sided love, being in love with someone who is not in love with you and I understand why divorces get messy but at the same time, again, just from my own perspective, why bother with all the legal nonsense"
10502,ZrozaRkraD,"and I don't see what's wrong with believing that. I know people think it is childish to believe this, however, I think you are the child if you don't believe in unconditional love. That you are emotionally stunted or not fully matured in some way."
10503,ZrozaRkraD,"so that means it's quite literally impossible to ""fall out of love"" or to stop loving someone

because if that happens that means you were never in love to begin with

it was just a crush, or lust, or romance, or sexual, or something else that isn't love"
10504,ZrozaRkraD,"I guess that's just how I see it because I cannot ever picture myself in the scenario of having gotten married for the wrong reason lol

this is only because I believe in true love and I think love comes before marriage 

and that love is unconditional"
10505,ZrozaRkraD,"Meaning if you ever were to end up having to divorce someone because being together no longer suits either of your functions, goals, purposes

then it is amicable

therefore, should want the best for them and be willing to give them everything you can for it to work out"
10506,ZrozaRkraD,"This is because... I believe in marriage for love and love only. Not for any other reason whatsoever. Love and love ONLY. 

That's the only reason you should ever get married to someone."
10507,ZrozaRkraD,"I understand how this probably comes across

Don't worry, I would literally never divorce Mercy

I love her more than anything 

This was all just genuine hypothetical thinking https://t.co/Umf3qcuigS"

10515,ZrozaRkraD,And as long as you love and have good intentions and do the right thing you will always be okay

10517,ZrozaRkraD,"You don't need any possessions or money to make it in this world, you can start with nothing and build yourself up"
10518,ZrozaRkraD,"Men are stupid when they try to get things out of a divorce, just let the woman win everything and you will be happier and stress free"
10519,ZrozaRkraD,Plus I love her so it's like make it as easy as possible for her and I can just go about my life without all the nonsense
10520,ZrozaRkraD,"People do the divorce game all the wrong way. Like why even go to court and argue over who gets what? Theoretically, if I were to ever divorce Mercy, I would just give her literally everything, all the money, all the stuff and things

Material possessions and money are useless"
10521,ZrozaRkraD,"@memesiwish Idk sometimes I accidentally like things or I like things in a passive-aggressive way 

I also don't even tend to stalk people's likes... I think it's not a great indicator of who they are. Some people just like tweets for the hell of it, some take liking a tweet very seriously"

stuff like that

I have the this whole concept"

10525,ZrozaRkraD,Squid Game but they lied to you and even if you win you get no money and they kill you anyway for their own amusement
10526,ZrozaRkraD,"You need to reassure yourself that you're good and that you can do things in order to get ahead, to accomplish goals"
10527,ZrozaRkraD,"I hate people who conflate self-confidence with narcissism 

Why don't you love yourself? Why don't you think you're good enough? Why don't you have any respect for yourself? Why do you compare yourself to others? Why do you want to be like other people when you can be better?"

10534,ZrozaRkraD,"@Mjpersonalt support local businesses and stuff and don't fall for the podcasts, blogs, and big Twitter accounts who are just trying to push their nonsense products and just buy American and not their garbage lol, it helps put the local economy"
10535,ZrozaRkraD,@Mjpersonalt idk I think people should just purchase more local goods and not buy into all these scam products like holistic things and alternative products for diets and stuff we have things that work and have always worked but the time is ripe for scamming tons of people
10536,ZrozaRkraD,@Mjpersonalt and it's like... do you actually enjoy all of that stuff or have you even tried watching and listening to the smaller talents and people without followers and subscribers lol
10537,ZrozaRkraD,"@Mjpersonalt But the wrong kind of art and entertainment. Nobody buys from the local artists, nobody watches the small guys on YouTube, they just keep funneling money into the biggest players and people with the largest platforms"
10538,ZrozaRkraD,"@Mjpersonalt people don't get paid enough, service workers don't get paid enough, the entire work force is mismanaged and the money is being improperly distributed, the markets are far from free, and too much money is placed in arts and entertainment"
10539,ZrozaRkraD,"@Mjpersonalt like 1920s/1930s level bad, dust bowl, extreme poverty, etc.

10550,ZrozaRkraD,I think simply sharing links to things is not a crime like if you see something bad and want to expose it to others so they can see that something is bad then they can take action to address it or remove it
10551,ZrozaRkraD,"Treat social media as if it is not real, it's just a playground for thoughts and ideas and discussion

An open forum

You cannot take ANYTHING you see on social media seriously

The internet should be totally free to do whatever you want and say and type and speak"

10553,ZrozaRkraD,"I don't care if you lose your job and everyone hates you and nobody wants to talk to you or be your friend anymore because of lies or bullshit

That just speaks volumes about those people, it says more about them then it does about you. Anyone can say anything about you."
10554,ZrozaRkraD,"Yes if people want to say all sorts of bad shit about you that isn't true they have the right to because it's up to the reciever of the information to interpret whether or not it's the truth. If they believe it, then they believe it, if they don't believe it, then they don't"

Anyone can be friends"

10624,ZrozaRkraD,"@PolarisTheNorth but if they don't say anything all I can do is operate on assumptions and it doesn't matter how obvious it is unless it's plainly laid out, it's still just me making assumptions, drawing conclusions

it's just how my mind works, I don't like not knowing things"
10625,ZrozaRkraD,"@PolarisTheNorth it's just how I operate, my insecurities, it's just comforting to me if people can just be straightforward with me even if it's hurtful and mean and whatever at least you are being honest"
10626,ZrozaRkraD,"@PolarisTheNorth it's not about them at that point, it's so I can have some introspection and try to behave differently towards new people I meet"
10627,ZrozaRkraD,"@PolarisTheNorth maybe we are different then because I absolutely would prefer someone tell me they hate me vs just not telling me anything at all

like it'll hurt but then I can get over it because at least I know like damn they really do just hate me"
10628,ZrozaRkraD,"@PolarisTheNorth we are on the same page habibi I'm just sensitive and always want to know why people don't like me so I can try to be better or know if they simply don't like me based on some bullshit that's not true at all

God knows the truth and that's good enough for me"
10629,ZrozaRkraD,@PolarisTheNorth but yeah obviously it's nobody's responsibility to make me feel good or validate me
10630,ZrozaRkraD,"@PolarisTheNorth Like at the end of the day it doesn't even matter if you did it on your own or because of someone else, but if it were me personally losing a friend I'd at least want some closure, it would make me feel better and help me move on"
10631,ZrozaRkraD,"@PolarisTheNorth you can't and that's the problem really I'm doing the schizoposting thing here where I'm talking about intentions like when I said people saying something fucked up and then claiming it's a joke how do you know if they're lying or not

matter of just believing someone ig"
10632,ZrozaRkraD,@PolarisTheNorth Or they want to be in a relationship with that person so they'll manipulate and twist it
10633,ZrozaRkraD,"@PolarisTheNorth because that's a pretty manipulative tactic too... lots of people who are like ""oh I'm just looking out for you"" but in reality it's just because they don't want you to be friends with someone or they're jealous or in some cases they want to be friends with that person"
10634,ZrozaRkraD,"@PolarisTheNorth I can think of tons of relationships and friendships ruined because others got their input in before we had a chance to work things out ourselves and those people providing input had selfish intentions and not ""just trying to care for you"""
10635,ZrozaRkraD,@PolarisTheNorth but there absolutely are people who are so bitter and evil and manipulative that they will go out of their way to try to tell you that someone is really bad and evil and use all these justifications and it further complicates things if you didn't talk to that person first
10636,ZrozaRkraD,"@PolarisTheNorth decisions because of not decisions with consideration of 

there is a very clear difference and I think we are just saying the same thing lol

Quite literally when you execute an action... doing on your own at the very end of the chain vs doing because someone else told you to"
10637,ZrozaRkraD,"@PolarisTheNorth like maybe you remind me someone really sucks and they've really hurt me and done all these things and haven't changed and I let my judgement get clouded and then I remember yeah, they suck, I'm not making up with them, that's fine I think"
10638,ZrozaRkraD,"@PolarisTheNorth but at the end of the day if you're choosing to or not to do something because someone else told you what to do then you are not thinking for yourself

if you are choosing to do things because you've considered their input and agree with it, that is different"
10639,ZrozaRkraD,"@PolarisTheNorth I agree it's okay to provide advice and input but you as the person should not blindly follow what others tell you, you should consider it absolutely and it's always great to have as many perspectives, opinions and as much input as possible"
10640,ZrozaRkraD,"This is no different than having multiple children as a parent because then you start to play favorites or ranking your children or whatever instead of treating them as separate

and it's like you can have equal treatment but ultimately every single person is different"
10641,ZrozaRkraD,"Because is that not what you do with even friend groups? Friend groups where there is a ""leader"" are incredibly toxic IMO and subject to tons of problems. Nobody should be the leader. Every friendship should be an exclusive mutual one-on-one relationship."
10642,ZrozaRkraD,Even in hypothetical poly relationship where Mercy and I had a girlfriend I'd think the bond between Mercy and I would still be an exclusive connection but our theoretical girlfriend would have an exclusive connection between me and one between Mercy
10643,ZrozaRkraD,"I am definitely super guilty of this, telling even Mercy some people suck or telling others they should avoid people or not trust them 

but I realize this is wrong 

all social connections should be one on one with no outside influence"
10644,ZrozaRkraD,"That's how I approach it all anyway. Hypothetical scenario maybe I am friends with someone, we have a serious falling out and we want to make up but Mercy is like you suck and you're bad then what favors am I doing you if I just refuse to make up with you because Mercy says so"
10645,ZrozaRkraD,"It's like, example, maybe you had a really bad falling out with a friend or an ex or something but they want to make up... decide on your own, not with the help of others"
10646,ZrozaRkraD,"I think, too, it HAS to be mutual and only between you and them and not your friends or family or others providing input 

I think the input of others has damaged a lot of healthy relationships and potential for forgiveness in a lot of cases"
10647,ZrozaRkraD,"Clears the tension, clears the bad air, cleans the bad blood, makes it easier to just move on and be friendly and act like nothing happened and like we can build trust again and be comfortable and happy"
10648,ZrozaRkraD,Some of my worst enemies have gone on to be really good friends of mine and I think that's just because they truly decide to trust me again and I decide to trust them and it just clears the tension more
10649,ZrozaRkraD,"And if there is no possible way to ever know someone's true intentions then it comes down to just believing someone whether they are lying or not, because you can't ever know if they ARE lying

it's just trust at that point"
10650,ZrozaRkraD,"for just about anything really but we have to both mutually agree to kiss and make up and be on good terms again and you have to believe it yourself, I have to believe it myself and we have to believe each other"
10651,ZrozaRkraD,"I think the only way out of this... social contract, or whatever you wanna call it, is to mutually agree to never do it again 

level the playing field, set a new precedent because I think nearly everything can be forgiven and I personally can make up with anyone"
10652,ZrozaRkraD,"And when you've done it yourself even one time, lying or not, you've set the precedent that it's forever okay to use it as a cop-out 

that's kind of how trust works"
10653,ZrozaRkraD,"Also intentions are important and have to remember you literally cannot read someone's mind or ever possibly know their intentions

Someone can just say ""oh I was joking it's not serious"" as much as they want, you can't call them a liar because you can't ever know"
10654,ZrozaRkraD,"""I was saying all this fucked up shit a year ago but I'm different now"" but then will try to cancel people for stuff they've said 10 years ago or whatever

make up your mind because I also think that's pretty black and white and not up for discussing nuance"
10655,ZrozaRkraD,"But anyway don't get too mad at me for saying stuff if you do it yourself

and don't be like ""oh that was me a year ago I've since changed""

10661,ZrozaRkraD,"Like even if I can think of some incredibly offensive shit I personally think is funny I know most of the general public would think is not vs some really harmless joke that has made me irrationally upset that wouldn't make most upset 

neither are good nor bad"
10662,ZrozaRkraD,"I think it is a black and white stance really, I don't think there is any room for nuance. You have to be okay with all or none IMO.

Only because I always stand by something making you feel bad doesn't mean it's bad just like something making you feel good doesn't mean it's good"
10663,ZrozaRkraD,"I still stand by anything and everything can be joked about no matter the subject. You should be allowed to. Obviously some things will come across as insensitive, mean or poorly timed but that's a matter of opinion really."
10664,ZrozaRkraD,"They are two different mindsets, I think, your intentions are definitely different and your attitude towards it is different"
10665,ZrozaRkraD,"I think there is a clear difference between longing for love, wanting it, or even longing for or wishing for someone specifically vs thinking it is owed to you, thinking you deserve someone else as if they were objects that should belong to you"

tell that to my ground beef lookin scalp"
11106,hamcarless,@CyanideAid 100%
11107,hamcarless,"@CyanideAid Right. But, keep in mind that accountability is good in these searchings and so is anchoring yourself on the true and important things.

A mind that is perpetually open is useless. It should open only to close on the truth."
11108,hamcarless,@CyanideAid Oh yeah. I‚Äôve been spending a lot of time hunting out the idiosyncrasies in what I was taught and really questioning them against the Bible.
11109,hamcarless,"@CyanideAid Also, these questions are fun, so don‚Äôt worry about it at all."
11110,hamcarless,"@CyanideAid Suffice it to say, our information on this particular being within scripture is extremely limited. So, there isn‚Äôt a lot that I could point to definitively on these points. There is some, but I can just speak to what I do know or have read."
11111,hamcarless,"@CyanideAid Something like a prosecutor in terms of judgement. I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve read the Hebrew, but my understanding from people who have is that there is no ‚Äúthe‚Äù in front of ‚Äúsatan‚Äù in that‚Äôs story. I could be wrong though."
11112,hamcarless,"@CyanideAid But, there is a difference between a satan and the Satan. The text, when referring to that specific being has that article in front of it. But, the word itself means ‚Äúadversary.‚Äù

So, in the divine council vignette within Job, it could be a job within the court."
11113,hamcarless,@CyanideAid That‚Äôs sort of a matter of reading and interpretation. There are people on both sides. The one mentioned in Isaiah was almost certainly a king being spoken to as well as a potential dual story about the Satan.

11122,hamcarless,"@CyanideAid so, I‚Äôd much rather not show him any respect. especially using Lucifer. any number of titles or disparagements are better in my opinion."
11123,hamcarless,"@CyanideAid if you take into consideration the concept that the devil wished to become the almighty and you see this usage with Christ, you see him claiming this as something someone of his character would do. it sounds to me like a claim he would like."
11124,hamcarless,"@CyanideAid he was called the serpent, the Satan, and the devil.

Lucifer means morning star or light-bringer. this has some parallels in paganism, but not from Semitic literature from what I‚Äôve seen.

in fact, this same word is used to describe Jesus. so, I conclude that it isn‚Äôt his name."
11125,hamcarless,"@CyanideAid he was not named. naming is definitely an act of respect and also a part of God‚Äôs creating/ordering the universe.

I‚Äôm not saying this is exactly the same situation, but notice that in the parable, Lazarus is named and the rich man isn‚Äôt."
11126,hamcarless,"just so you know, Lucifer is not his name and he likes it when people call him that."

15941,burnabymartin,"@stuartd37 @safesurrey2018 @bobmackin @npffpn Anyways, back to the question of the hour...

20301,CamaroWRX,"@AFisRetiredAF @SmPotatoes @ModeratelyMoco @avisilber88 @CaitlynnPeetz14 There would also need to be PD on how to assess on a mastery level (Highly Proficient, Proficient, Progressing, Not Yet Proficient) and decisions made on the minimum number of standards needed for progression/passing.

20302,CamaroWRX,"@AFisRetiredAF @SmPotatoes @ModeratelyMoco @avisilber88 @CaitlynnPeetz14 To fully go to standards based grading, we would need smaller class sizes for more individualized work with students who need those revision/reassessment opportunities.

20303,CamaroWRX,"@AFisRetiredAF @SmPotatoes @ModeratelyMoco @avisilber88 @CaitlynnPeetz14 And in fact, I think SBG is superior. Students should achieve mastery of standards.

24108,sally_hines,Questionable (from my perspective) feminists have always existed. I stopped being confused about this as a teenager when I read Andrea Dworkins Right Wing Women and Bea Cambells book on Tory women whose title that I forget.
24109,sally_hines,@RozKaveney The older I get the more I think about those meetings. I found them in City Limits and came on my own. I was just 20.
24110,sally_hines,I‚Äôll never forget the coat hanger. And I‚Äôll always connect the coat hanger to the manipulation of fear around gender difference. Bad blood. But I‚Äôll always think about joy. And hope. And the promise of a better gendered life. Good blood.
24111,sally_hines,It all started as a kid when I asked my step mum why that magazine had a coat hanger dripping with blood on its front cover - and why did it have such a weird name (Spare Rib). And all these decades later and I‚Äôm worrying again about the coat hanger.
24112,sally_hines,"These days I want to do all I can to ensure that trans researchers get to work on trans. My job is to move over. I don‚Äôt think that I became a professor because of doing work on trans so early, though it certainly helped."
24113,sally_hines,"These projects weren‚Äôt ‚Äòsupported‚Äô by trans researchers, they were made by them. And while I always strive to assist them to build their careers through  for instance named publications, grant writing support, I, of course. benefit the most. I get promoted. Invited. Named."
24114,sally_hines,"The institution were excited-cutting edge, newsworthy, perfect for EDI auditing. It was an absolute no from me. Never. The success of my trans‚Äô projects were all because of the trans researchers - the wonderful @NotRightRuth for example."
24115,sally_hines,I‚Äôd built up community relationships. I costed in activist groups as consultants. I employed trans and queer women. But it started to feel different. On getting my professorship it was assumed by the panel that I would become Professor of Transgender Studies.
24116,sally_hines,I began to work on citizenship and critiques of rights based politics. I found I loved writing and began to get published (a lot!) I won more bids. Was invited to events. Got promoted. I had a profile. I was a cis woman. I was working on trans.
24117,sally_hines,"I did talk about my positionality but briefly and in what I now think was a very weak way. It was 2004, the GRA had passed. I got funding to look at the GRA. On this project I began to think a lot about doing the work as a cis woman."
24118,sally_hines,Still no one raised my being cis. Other people in gender studies and sociology began to focus on trans issues in PhDs. My amazing friend @zowiedavy who I began to have this - and so many more - conversation with. I finished my PhD and wrote my first book.
24119,sally_hines,People with so much joy and With significant trauma and mental health issues. So many people wanted to talk. For hours. There were so many more people I couldn‚Äôt interview. Something was shifting. Nadia had won Big Brother. People wanted to talk. And be heard.
24120,sally_hines,"I stayed for hours. For dinner. Into the evenings. I was doing repeat interviews so back I went. For almost a year. I also spoke to women who were more familiar to me, lesbian trans women, musicians, performers. And bus drivers and women without jobs."
24121,sally_hines,I‚Äôd never spoke to a straight trans women before. Women who lived and loved their wives of decades but were definite they weren‚Äôt lesbian. Women who desired and were desired by straight men. Women whose politics were so different to mine. I didn‚Äôt know any Tories or even Liberals
24122,sally_hines,"‚ÄòReal life test‚Äô, public outings and job losses, loosing family and children. Violence. Abuse. Stigma. Shame. This was miles away from Chain Reaction. And I went to meetings and conferences - GENDES. Voice workshops. Discos. Ball gowns. Fancy hair and even fancier make up"
24123,sally_hines,But it worked. It was *all* about self determination and bodily autonomy. And i began to think about legal and medical practices - institutional regulation. I knew about the politics of performance and gender subversion. I went on to learn so much more.
24124,sally_hines,"Risk assessments didn‚Äôt exist and I travelled around the UK on the train alone, went to peoples houses. Met in bars or cafes. I interviewed 50 people-trans men and women. I‚Äôd go from an interview with a Drag King in Highgate one day to a country conservative councillor the next."
24125,sally_hines,My plan was around subversive genders - it was about the London stuff.  For funding I had to broaden it out and it came to include trans women. I didn‚Äôt think about being cis. No one asked me - until much later - about being cis. It‚Äôs unreal to think that now.
24126,sally_hines,I had a baby. Moved from London. Taught in Adult Ed and FE. I‚Äôd done a year of a part time self funded PhD in London - young women and rave. Left it to earn as a mum. Always had doing a PhD sitting in my head. And I met the perfect person at the right time and amazingly got funds
24127,sally_hines,"Women around me began social transitioning. My ex‚Äôs traumas made sense. Communities began to be formed. FtM London, Del ‚Äòs photos, Jack‚Äôs and Jay‚Äôs books. Stephen and Press for Change."
24128,sally_hines,"Coming from Greenham, this ‚Äòscene‚Äô made sense. I knew it‚Äôs people. It was as it had been. As it should be. Remaking gender. Twisting - and being twisted by - sex. Forging a different future."
24129,sally_hines,"I joined Feminist Against Censorship, recently formed by @RozKaveney I was the youngest and I was shy-I think for the first time in my life. I didn‚Äôt say much but I loved it. I was in awe. This was the early 1990s. Battles were about porn, leather. BDSM and body mod. Butch/femme"
24130,sally_hines,"Lesbians hadn‚Äôt, in our lives, had sex in public, role played, performed. Performance was central. Politics of performance and rebellion. Politics of filth. And it was creative and so very funny. Smart. So I went out a lot. Going out, dressing up, acting out, was our politics."
24131,sally_hines,"It was also brilliant fun. For me as a young woman new to London to start a degree. Living with my partner who was trans before we knew that was different from Stone. Before we knew how to really think about it. Still, we were young. The clubs were raucous, so sexy. Outrageous."
24132,sally_hines,"Politics of the body and sexuality were central as now in the terf wars. Attempts by some feminists to police that which they saw as undesirable, perverted, in others. Battles raged. In lesbian community centres, bars, clubs. It was vicious."
24133,sally_hines,And of course there was @stephenwhittle and @susanstryker Mine was about social movements and gender diverse (sub)cultures. A big focus was the relationship between feminism and trans. This way preceded terfism and linked to its forerunner the sex wars.
24134,sally_hines,It also looked at communities of care. There were three other UK sociologists doing related work/Richard Ekins and Dave King‚Äôs joint work and @SuryaMonro5432 who had started her PhD a year before. Surya‚Äôs work was more policy focused than mine. Ekins and King‚Äôs more typography.
24135,sally_hines,"There is no way that I would/could do the PhD that I did now. As a cis woman it wouldn‚Äôt and couldn‚Äôt be done. I started it in 2000 - 22 years ago and finished 3 years later. It was a sociology of gender diversity - identity formation and practice, politics and communities."
24136,sally_hines,"@quollhorreur Top eyelashes, the very best shade of red lip - and shucks, those ears!"
24137,sally_hines,"RT @quollhorreur: @sally_hines Yep. This will always be remembered.

24141,sally_hines,@quollhorreur I‚Äôll never forgive. I just won‚Äôt/can‚Äôt. And I‚Äôm cis!!
24142,sally_hines,@quollhorreur Absolutely.
24143,sally_hines,Where were you? Bodily autonomy is a cornerstone of feminism and always at the top of the hit list. We did try to tell you that your body was next. Where were you?
24144,sally_hines,"I‚Äôm also deeply angered and saddened, but not at all surprised, that some who call themselves feminists have enabled this discourse while others - read cis, middle class, white, largely straight, and able bodied - have stood quietly by."
24145,sally_hines,"Anti-trans, anti-abortion, anti-gender agendas cannot be separated and such agendas are cut through with classism, racism, homophobia and ableism. As has always been so."
24146,sally_hines,I am deeply angered and saddened by Wade V Roe but not at all surprised. The curtailing of cis women‚Äôs reproductive rights goes hand in hand with attacks on trans people‚Äôs bodily autonomy and is intertwined with an anti-gender politics that is evident in many parts of Europe.

24269,sally_hines,@RoseEMR85 @KateLyle So what changed in your view?
24270,sally_hines,@RoseEMR85 @KateLyle So... If someone 'actually passes' how do you know they are a 'transsexual'? How many 'male persons' apart from cleaners and children have you ever met in a women's toilet in your day-to-day life?
24271,sally_hines,"@RoseEMR85 @KateLyle So 2016 brought a demographic shift from 'a tiny number of transsexuals' to 600,000 trans and/or gender non-conforming people?"
24272,sally_hines,@KateLyle That is just all entirely speculative. There is no evidence to any of that. How do you know what genitals someone is 'likely' to have and how do you know what someone understands or doesn't? And how did all this suddenly change in 2016?  None of this makes sense
24273,sally_hines,@KateLyle Thank you for being the first person to answer. Why was the context entirely different?

24284,sally_hines,They can't say that trans women have been using women's toilets for decades because it would then be crystal clear that all this has got nothing to do with toilets and everything to do with a concerted and very dishonest attempt to police womanhood and strip away civil rights
24285,sally_hines,Gender crits remind me of young toddlers who think that if they can't see you - for e.g. if they put their hands in front of their face or hide behind a cushion - then you can't see them. They have never passed that developmental stage.
24286,sally_hines,@KatyMontgomerie Indeed
24287,sally_hines,"@salltweets @mcdonnelljp @Belstaffie @TheArbourist And of course thats a non-answer.  You can't answer because you can't tell the truth, which is that trans women, as women, have been using the women's toilet for always."

24381,sally_hines,We made a decision and we must stand by that and move on. I have nothing to add now. Please read the statement before commenting publicly. I will send the statement out in a new tweet
24382,sally_hines,Last week was an agonising week for us. We had to make an imperfect decision in an imperfect context. We knew that we would upset and anger some sections of our membership whichever decision we made. We understand and respect the decision of those who will not attend.
24383,sally_hines,People on Twitter who are not members of FGEN are increasingly getting involved in the discussion. This means that they haven‚Äôt got information about the history or the wider context.
24384,sally_hines,#FGEN steering committee and conference team have decided to make public the statement we sent to our members regarding our very difficult decision to go ahead with our conference at Shoreditch Town Hall at the beginning of next month.
24385,sally_hines,@Felix_F_Fern @chrissyleansl @DocPhoenix Because I realised that the tweet was being read as relating to trans communities as a whole when I was referring to FGEN members.
24386,sally_hines,"@jenslater_ I‚Äôm very sorry if I made you feel that way Jen. My point was that the ‚Äòmajority‚Äô - not all but the majority - of trans members - especially trans women members,wanted us to go ahead. Thats is the case. I very much respect the decisions of people who don‚Äôt want to attend."
24387,sally_hines,"@jenslater_ As I‚Äôve said, I understand and respect your decision Jen."

24390,sally_hines,@Felix_F_Fern @chrissyleansl @DocPhoenix It just feels like you are getting involved in bad faith when you don‚Äôt seem aware of the full context
24391,sally_hines,@Felix_F_Fern @chrissyleansl @DocPhoenix I‚Äôm not saying your critique doesn‚Äôt stand. Indeed there are many ‚Äòadministrative errors‚Äô at play here as we address in the statement
24392,sally_hines,@Felix_F_Fern @chrissyleansl @DocPhoenix ‚ÄòInvesting energy‚Äô seems to me a little over the top! I‚Äôm simply replying to a critique that you made without having sufficient info.
24393,sally_hines,@Felix_F_Fern @chrissyleansl @DocPhoenix I said that communications suggested that the majority of trans people and especially trans women wanted the conference to go ahead. I don‚Äôt see how that is weaponisation. It is as it is.
24394,sally_hines,@Felix_F_Fern @chrissyleansl @DocPhoenix I think it would be helpful for you to read the statement before we engage further. It‚Äôs 4 pages and pretty complicated
24395,sally_hines,"@Felix_F_Fern @chrissyleansl @DocPhoenix Hi Felix, I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre an FGEN member so you won‚Äôt have received the statement on our decision. Maybe you could ask someone to send it to you? You‚Äôll see that we can‚Äôt hold at any other time."

24412,sally_hines,#FGEN conference. An extremely difficult decision had to be made. It had to be made quite quickly. A decision was reached that we knew would be imperfect. We put out a 4 page statement in which we tried to address the complexities - and imperfection - of it all.

24434,sally_hines,"@DisabledJess Jess, in the Discord thread, you basically accused me of lying about the point in the statement which said that the majority of trans people, and especially trans women, did not want us to cancel. We said ‚Äòmajority‚Äô and that‚Äôs how it is"

24436,sally_hines,"@criptimelord This isn‚Äôt about ‚Äòme‚Äô . WE - FGEN Steerco- who are, by the way, majority trans and non binary, made a very difficult decision. We didn‚Äôt discount anyones views."
24437,sally_hines,@DocPhoenix @willbelshah It was always going to be a kick in the teeth for some people. We made a very difficult call. It‚Äôs been a nightmare. Being told that I‚Äôm lying by cis people when I say what came out of the consultation is insulting and politically problematic.

24439,sally_hines,@DocPhoenix @willbelshah This is how it is. I‚Äôm not lying. I‚Äôm not justifying. And I think that this (who wants what) is not being listened to. And I think that‚Äôs worrying.

24452,sally_hines,@DocPhoenix @edmund_cf I thought it was the start of a cracking joke and you‚Äôd provide the punchline
24453,sally_hines,@jobrydon @DocPhoenix @edmund_cf I know!
24454,sally_hines,@Chican3ry @DocPhoenix @edmund_cf Can‚Äôt you be wrong for once
24455,sally_hines,@kimadactl @NetworkGender We have said in our email today that we have had problems with comms that we are addressing. We are listening.
24456,sally_hines,@kimadactl @NetworkGender I apologised for those tweets the minute they were drawn to my attention
24457,sally_hines,@Chican3ry The money that was going to fund the conference will go straight back. Wasted money.
24458,sally_hines,"@Chican3ry Well, ironically, that is exactly what I was trying to do!!!!"
24459,sally_hines,@edmund_cf Ok. Yes. Trying not to have to return money is a big part of the issue here. And the immediacy that comes with financial timelines. We could have waited for 5 years to crowd fund I guess (said in despair and confusion not snark)
24460,sally_hines,@edmund_cf Can you please say more Ned‚Ä¶
24461,sally_hines,"@DocPhoenix @edmund_cf Genuine question, is Julia Serrano an academic or an activist?"
24462,sally_hines,"That is, for example, why we are formalising our network as a community company, rather than a cross uni research centre. We are reflecting on the views of academics, which are very mixed, and non-academic members, and our members inside and outside the UK."
24463,sally_hines,"I‚Äôm not saying very much about the #FGEN conference on here until we complete the consultation, which to me, right now, is key. But I do think I need to say that while we have many academic members, we never set out to be an academic organisation."

24468,sally_hines,@Chican3ry I made it very clear last night that I was not happy with those tweets.

24470,sally_hines,@Chican3ry ‚Ä¶ unproductive - and actually counter - to the way you say you would have liked to see things go.
24471,sally_hines,@Chican3ry Things sometimes take a little time. The speed at which we were shot down was unproductive.
24472,sally_hines,@Chican3ry What is extremely frustrating is that we (conf org team) are all striking members of UCU. Some of us are union officials. Some of us are trans. Some of us are queer. Some of us have disabilities. We are all exhausted.
24473,sally_hines,@TheatreSpoonie @Seinneann
24474,sally_hines,@Chican3ry Publicly denouncing FGEN as a scabbing organisation when we had made clear that we were beginning a period of consultation with the UCU and members is not ordinary or necessary. We are asking for discussion about the very points in your last tweet here.
24475,sally_hines,@Chican3ry We are trying to open up dialogue about what to do. This process has only just begun and is ongoing  I have said that concerns are being heard. I have said I respect and hear the criticism. Who is shaming who?
24476,sally_hines,@hagenilda @matilda_jt @DrLizzieBennett No one will be blaming the Union for anything Jo

24480,sally_hines,@Felix_F_Fern Im trying to gauge the views of all members and open up discussion between members. Discussion can‚Äôt take place in my inbox
24481,sally_hines,Got to step away from this for the rest of the day to teach. I will catch up on emails and tweets
24482,sally_hines,"#FGEN conference If they feel able, I think it would be productive if members who have emailed me with the view that we should go ahead also shared this publicly under #FGEN The range of views should be known"
24483,sally_hines,"@drrhianelinor Yup, see my tweet just now!"
24484,sally_hines,#FGEN conference. *If* we cancel the event it will be because we have come to realise that it breaks UCU action despite the efforts re network autonomy from HE. This will mean it also breaks ASOS (re Sat) and rescheduling principles so we will cancel both days/the whole event https://t.co/na6kRSgX7F
24485,sally_hines,@Chris_A_W Thanks Chris
24486,sally_hines,"Genuine question‚Ä¶ If the Friday was restructured so that it was not a presentation of academics research but creative/debate focused, would having keynotes - Julia Serrano - be problematic??"

24495,sally_hines,@DocPhoenix @NetworkGender Im not at all sure on this. The separation of my ‚Äòresearch‚Äô and my politics for eg is impossible.
24496,sally_hines,"@DocPhoenix @NetworkGender Thanks Phoenix. Yes, we need to discuss principles etc. The conference teams thinking *was* to have the first day as a teach out and get backing from UCU for this. What do you see as the problems there??"
24497,sally_hines,"@jobrydon Hi Jo, I‚Äôm sending out an email this morning asking for members views‚Ä¶ Also talking again to UCU"
24498,sally_hines,@Chican3ry @NetworkGender All points of criticism are being heard and are being taken seriously. This can‚Äôt be worked through without some time to consult with members and UCU though.
24499,sally_hines,@fran_amery @NetworkGender Of course people are allowed to dissent! But I need time to consult and Twitter does not do time - and that can be toxic
24500,sally_hines,"As I said in my members email last night, I am hoping we can have the first day as a teach out. I will clarify when things have been fully discussed and will email members this morning asking for views."
24501,sally_hines,"As for the clash on the first day of the conference with UCU strike, I am consulting with UCU and FGEN members today. This will take a little time and I don‚Äôt think the way forward is to be found arguing on here."
24502,sally_hines,As founder and co-lead of @NetworkGender I unreservedly apologise for any hurt caused by posts sent out from the networks social media account last night.

24506,sally_hines,#FGEN conference Last night I asked for some space so that @NetworkGender could reflect and discuss things with members and UCU. Some people - who are not FGEN or UCU members!- are not respecting this. Their behaviour is gold to our opponents.
24507,sally_hines,@without_history @QueerDisability @NetworkGender If asked for some space while we reflect and discuss with members and the UCU. Can you please respect that?
