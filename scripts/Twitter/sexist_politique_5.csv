4169,RepTroyCarter,Full statement here (11/11): https://t.co/Ias7nEjexL
4170,RepTroyCarter,"Elections have consequences, but those consequences should never be the deprivation of rights once given. 

This decision is lawless and flies in the face of precedent. Not only the precedents of Roe and Casey, but every precedent in American history. (9/11)"
4171,RepTroyCarter,"Elections have consequences, but those consequences should never be the deprivation of rights once given. 

This decision is lawless and flies in the face of precedent. Not only the precedent of Roe and Casey, but every precedent in American history. (9/11)"
4172,RepTroyCarter,"The courts gave the right to contraception, the courts gave women the right to have a credit card. The courts gave everyone in America the right to marry the person they love, of any race or gender.

Just like reproductive rights, the courts could take these rights away. (8/11)"
4173,RepTroyCarter,"Now, we must ask ourselves the question: if some rights are not sacred in this nation, are any rights sacred?

Trump planted far-right judges into our judiciary, and now we are witnessing the first sprouts of those evil seeds. Unfortunately, there is more to come. (7/11)"
4174,RepTroyCarter,"This new reality not only includes forced birth, but potentially death from unsafe medical procedures or dangerous pregnancies.

This ruling isn't about life, it‚Äôs about control. If it were about life, we would invest in prenatal care, free pre-K, and more (6/11)."
4175,RepTroyCarter,"This is especially true for low-income, Black, Indigenous, and women of color in our state who already faced devastatingly high rates of maternal mortality and poor maternal health outcomes.

For them and others, this post-Roe reality is even more perilous than before. (5/11)"
4176,RepTroyCarter,"Even under Roe we were already failing mothers ‚Äì the US. has the worst maternal mortality rate of any developed nation, &amp; Black women face disproportionately poor outcomes.

It's heartbreaking that those who already had the fewest resources are now left without any options (4/11)"
4177,RepTroyCarter,"For Louisianians, we have entered a dark new stage of our state‚Äôs history. New restrictions have been triggered outlawing all abortion in our state, with minimal exceptions for safety or circumstance.

This is a public health disaster (3/11)"
4178,RepTroyCarter,"I am a person of faith, but I also hold faith in the people ‚Äì in my brothers, sisters, and neighbors. I have faith in America, and the liberties we hold dear.

I believe we must all have the chance to make the right choices for ourselves. That‚Äôs what freedom is all about. (2/11)"
4179,RepTroyCarter,"Today SCOTUS took away the rights and freedoms of the American people for the first time in  history.
