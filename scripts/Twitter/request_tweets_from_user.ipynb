      "Lesbians hadn‚Äôt, in our lives, had sex in public, role played, performed. Performance was central. Politics of performance and rebellion. Politics of filth. And it was creative and so very funny. Smart. So I went out a lot. Going out, dressing up, acting out, was our politics.\n",
      "It was also brilliant fun. For me as a young woman new to London to start a degree. Living with my partner who was trans before we knew that was different from Stone. Before we knew how to really think about it. Still, we were young. The clubs were raucous, so sexy. Outrageous.\n",
      "Politics of the body and sexuality were central as now in the terf wars. Attempts by some feminists to police that which they saw as undesirable, perverted, in others. Battles raged. In lesbian community centres, bars, clubs. It was vicious.\n",

      "There is no way that I would/could do the PhD that I did now. As a cis woman it wouldn‚Äôt and couldn‚Äôt be done. I started it in 2000 - 22 years ago and finished 3 years later. It was a sociology of gender diversity - identity formation and practice, politics and communities.\n",
