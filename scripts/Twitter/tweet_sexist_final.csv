812,StevenSiller,@ArtofBorbor @rotor_motor13b We draw rather different conclusions from the same paper. Twitter not the best platform to pull that apart though.

813,StevenSiller,"@ArtofBorbor @rotor_motor13b Ideal outcome is to choose strategy most likely to lead to fewest exposures.

814,StevenSiller,@ArtofBorbor @rotor_motor13b This evidence for this is unclear.

817,StevenSiller,"@ArtofBorbor @rotor_motor13b Read the conclusion, where it states that, in the case of myocarditis, this was not the case for those under 40. Rather 15:100k(vax) versus 10:100k(covid). Other recent studies out there showing similar results."

819,StevenSiller,"@ArtofBorbor @rotor_motor13b Um, what totalitarian country do you live in? Most vaxes not mandatory in most countries.

823,StevenSiller,"@ArtofBorbor @rotor_motor13b German Health ministry states 4 shots = 1:1250 total chance of hospitalisation/serious injury/death, so given insurance data suggests higher rate by more objective reporting method (i.e. $), then original articles suggestion of 1:500 not unbelievable.

825,StevenSiller,"@ArtofBorbor @rotor_motor13b (3) The decision to apply vaccine is cost benefit analysis. Serious side effect rates are important, e.g. myocarditis is more common in under 40s post vaccination than post covid (recent UK study).

As vaccine is very leaky except for short interval, little community benefit 1/2"
826,StevenSiller,"@ArtofBorbor @rotor_motor13b Similarly, local small community of younger men (200ish) I interact with had two cases of men going on medication for myocarditis post-vax, together with a number of others reporting heart pain that was dismissed at ER. Initial TGA values of 1.8/100k clearly not right. 4/4"
827,StevenSiller,"@ArtofBorbor @rotor_motor13b Of course, these things happen to old people all the time. Nevertheless, timing strange.

2973,ZrozaRkraD,"@PolarisTheNorth I get what you are saying though, obviously it's because they do not think women should be in combat but some of that has changed the past several years 

it is kind of rooted in biology, I know it sounds really stupid but body odors and things like that and sexual stuff"
2974,ZrozaRkraD,"@PolarisTheNorth I know

That was like in 2016"
2983,ZrozaRkraD,"but then you start to realize that the F-22 has been in development since the 80s

But that the F-15 and F-16, which still BOTH get constant upgrades, started in the 60s

so why compared a less than 20 year old aircraft to aircraft that are nearly 60 years old"
2984,ZrozaRkraD,"but like... it's only really been in developing the past 15+ years, and not even really operational until the past 5 years or so... which seems like a really long time but again, barely ever actually used compared to other aircraft"
2985,ZrozaRkraD,"there is also the problem of needing to use stuff in real-world situations. I remember F-35 discourse and how much people hate it but it's actually a really cool jet (all three versions) especially with AI stuff, drone integration and lots of new tech"

but if you don't do this stuff then you just end up like Russia right now with actual wasted money because half your stuff just doesn't work"
2988,ZrozaRkraD,"all peacetime stuff our military does is literally just daily training and preparation 

there is a reason we constantly fly, use almost every vehicle and all of equipment, constantly have exercises, constantly use everything and look at everything"

3010,ZrozaRkraD,"of course I just let my ego and everything get in the way, refusal to accept reality sometimes that I just really needed to get some help but also have a lot to work on and try very hard to change my way of thinking, need to focus on more positive things"
3011,ZrozaRkraD,"And I am trying to tone down my social media usage because tons of stuff I've said I've just posted because of racing thoughts and just going down weird distracted trains of thought, getting distracted, reading way too far into things"
3012,ZrozaRkraD,"which is something I'm trying to actually take seriously now despite my past thoughts and feelings on the topic 

it's just gonna be a long process"
3013,ZrozaRkraD,"it's hard to explain because they were always like trying to tell us that you should but there was always like that passive-aggressive mood of ""but you shouldn't because it'll run your career"" kind of thing 

so I got into a habit of just trying to figure things out on my own"
3014,ZrozaRkraD,"I mean it's always been a problem but it just seems to get worse the older I get

So obviously it depends on the cost of schooling but that's max potential of... $212k

even more if you're in a more expensive state 

That's a decent amount for completing one term of enlistment"
3044,ZrozaRkraD,"plus you might get housing allowance, which for me would have been like $2200 a month lol

so that'd have been, for me, up to $27k a year for housing and supplies + $26k in tuition 

so assume a 4 year plan

that's almost $134k lol"

3117,ZrozaRkraD,"We make women feel so bad about their appearance and hurt their self-image over these things and I've always tried to recognize that these things are just a trick of the media, Hollywood and the pornography, cosmetic and fashion industry"
3118,ZrozaRkraD,"I think it's more natural and sexy to have hair on your arms, other places, things like that. Skin so-called ""defects"" are also beautiful. Scars. Freckles. Moles. Acne. Sun spots. Etc.

The fact that we've see things as ""ugly"" is purely media bullshit"
3119,ZrozaRkraD,"image of what humans should look like, anyway"
3120,ZrozaRkraD,I don't even understand why OP makes the correlation with children because what did humans do before any of this dumb shit existed? Society has conditioned itself to form sexual attractions to so many things that it's unreal how far we have fallen from nature and God's image.
3121,ZrozaRkraD,"I think people forget that human beings are... animals. Sexual attraction, in nature, is of the pure, natural, unmodified state. Animals do not wear clothes. They do not modify their appearance unless they already have the NATURAL ability to do so, they do not wear accessories"
3122,ZrozaRkraD,this has been probably been going on for over a century but I think it has been heavily ramped up in recent times due to the ease of being able to manipulate everyone's self-image
3123,ZrozaRkraD,"If you are to look at human history pre-media influence, people were more natural and were attracted to one another in the nude. Sure, cosmetics and things existed but the natural state was the purest form of sexual attraction."
3124,ZrozaRkraD,"You are classically conditioned, really from the time you are born, to to find all these different things sexually attractive via product placement in movies, TV, magazines, advertisements, pornography, internet content, etc."
3125,ZrozaRkraD,All of that stuff is... get this... UNNATURAL! It's man-made. Artificial. You literally have a Pavlovian response to associate sexual attraction with all of those things. It's unnatural... and what does unnatural mean... NOT NORMAL. Abnormal. Weird.
3126,ZrozaRkraD,"My Sister in Christ, natural women are... natural, so it's... literally human NATURE to be NATURALLY attracted to a person in their NATURAL biological state

The cosmetic surgeries, the implants, the clothing, the makeup, the accessories... literally psychological conditioning! https://t.co/5pvk2SPWig"

3143,ZrozaRkraD,and everything is uploading super fast so I might as well just do everything I can
3144,ZrozaRkraD,Luckily hindsight to name the files appropriately (for the most part) which should make it easier for some to find what they are looking for. I have some videos. I might as well just upload everything I have. I have 100+ GBs on my main Google Drive and 15 on my other one.

3147,ZrozaRkraD,"but I'd think anyway, all my Ghost stuff would have been on HDDs that are over 10 1/2 years old (yes it has been that long, strange to think of)"
3148,ZrozaRkraD,"again for like 14 months so who knows how long they were like that, then I was back in Korea for 2 years and they sat in a box in my closet. I didn't even check them til like several months ago and pretty much every single one didn't work or did the clicking thing"
3149,ZrozaRkraD,"What probably killed them (and ruined a lot of other stuff I had/still have) was sitting in a storage unit in Okinawa for like a year or so while I was in Korea, then again on a ship for months... SO much of my stuff was covered in black mold and wet from the moisture"
3150,ZrozaRkraD,"sitting in boxes for years, moving back and forth between three different countries, sitting in shipping containers on a ship for months at sea, not good for these things"
3151,ZrozaRkraD,The only reason I don't have video copies is because the original videos are all made in like 2011 - 2012 aka when actual hard drives were more the standard rather than SSDs. Of course I saved all of these but they are like ALL dead. The only ones that weren't had no TCR stuff.
3152,ZrozaRkraD,"but I don't condone this

if u are going to reupload my stuff then u do it in the original format, UNCENSORED 

Have some respect for the dead!!! (me and Ghost, aka the same people) https://t.co/wyss3SSIHo"
3153,ZrozaRkraD,"and then some... like entire 3 hour BTR rips, some stuff I probably never uploaded, stuff that's been deleted or DMCA'd

I can upload all of that to Google Drive or something"
3154,ZrozaRkraD,"maybe slightly irrational decision but rational thinking is not something I've been doing lately

but yeah I also honestly wanted to distance myself from the actual content forever ago, like years and years ago

I don't have any videos but I have pretty much all the audio files"
3155,ZrozaRkraD,"Sorry, the channel just makes me Very Sad now (just all the content I guess, I cannot watch any of it without feeling bad right now) + meant to do this years ago anyway but literally only saved to save my sub list.

3167,ZrozaRkraD,"@B0TFLY ig really I'm just trying to say I don't think gender roles and gender is very real other than on an ever-changing social level (but also that maybe the tr**ns stuff is not... very real, just a fetish or perversion exclusively, it is ALWAYS sexual for some reason)"
3168,ZrozaRkraD,"@B0TFLY first humans on earth when literally none of this stuff existed but most mental illnesses have ALWAYS existed just taken time to document or redefine 

transgenderism is documented in very ancient times and most surely has existed for tens of thousands of years"
3169,ZrozaRkraD,"@B0TFLY sex is biological and gender arguably doesn't exist... if gender dysphoria is what it is supposed to be, it should be purely mental not physical and go back to the literal first human beings on earth 

That is body dysmorphia and can happen regardless of gender identity"
3170,ZrozaRkraD,"@B0TFLY but really my point is, no clothing or external accessory, cosmetics, etc is possibly gendered or sex-based

just like blue and pink have not always been boy and girl

it's purely social standard that changes all the time

look as recently as the 80s lol"
3171,ZrozaRkraD,"@B0TFLY Makeup has def been worn by men always but I guess it depends on what you define a dress as, because dresses came from tunics as you said, but some are extremely similar in what you're define as maybe a couture, tapered dress (ig when I think most basic definition of a dress)"
3172,ZrozaRkraD,"@B0TFLY even like wigs and longer hairstyles and things?? All originally for men lol. If I'm to believe it's not actually just a fetish or some kinda mental illness then what did being tr*ns look like a few hundred years ago, a thousand years ago, surely gender dysphoria existed then??"
3173,ZrozaRkraD,"@B0TFLY yeah but it's like... why do they ALL seemingly have that exact description of the caricature of what women are 

I just wonder where it all comes from, especially because if you even go back through history... heels, dresses, makeup originally worn by... men, not women."
3174,ZrozaRkraD,"@B0TFLY my biggest problem with it is the fact that they define women as just being long hair, boobs, makeup, a dress and heels

how is that NOT sexist and to a further extent ‚Äî extremely perverted

also why are so many of them ""lesbian"" it just makes you further question their motives"

6574,CamaroWRX,"@AFisRetiredAF @SmPotatoes @ModeratelyMoco @avisilber88 @CaitlynnPeetz14 There would also need to be PD on how to assess on a mastery level (Highly Proficient, Proficient, Progressing, Not Yet Proficient) and decisions made on the minimum number of standards needed for progression/passing.

6575,CamaroWRX,"@AFisRetiredAF @SmPotatoes @ModeratelyMoco @avisilber88 @CaitlynnPeetz14 To fully go to standards based grading, we would need smaller class sizes for more individualized work with students who need those revision/reassessment opportunities.

6629,CamaroWRX,"@59NationalParks @naturetechfam This was a crazy ""speed-dating"" kind of #ParkChat, but I liked it! Thank you, @AliceLFord! (and thank you @tthrash for suggesting it could be done!)"
6630,CamaroWRX,"@SchmidtTravels @59NationalParks @AliceLFord @naturetechfam I know this feeling from last week. Fortunately for me, it was a ""regular"" week. #ParkChat"
6631,CamaroWRX,"@ocparkbuilder @AliceLFord @59NationalParks @naturetechfam @NationalMallNPS That's a good point. I'd like to see it before the Tidal Basin was created, and the Potomac lapped up near the Washington Monument! #ParkChat"
6632,CamaroWRX,"@59NationalParks @naturetechfam @AliceLFord A20 #ParkChat I like that there is more representation at the NPS sites (and by default, state parks too). More stories are being told, and so sites that were once one-sided are now more multi-dimensional."
6633,CamaroWRX,"@AliceLFord @59NationalParks @naturetechfam A18 #ParkChat While I'd be tempted to mention a Civil War battlefield, that would be during a war, and we're not Quantum Leaping it here. 

So I'm going to go with..... the Hopewell Culture site. To when the Natives lived there. And hopefully have a translator with me."
6634,CamaroWRX,@ocparkbuilder @AliceLFord @59NationalParks @naturetechfam Give me dates and I'll put in for a sub right now.
6635,CamaroWRX,@ocparkbuilder @AliceLFord @59NationalParks @naturetechfam .....Oh. Yeah. This sounds awesome. #ParkChat
6636,CamaroWRX,"@naturetechfam @59NationalParks @AliceLFord A18 #ParkChat I've been fortunate in that I've just dealt with rain (maybe heavy at times, but still just rain)."
6637,CamaroWRX,"@AliceLFord @59NationalParks @naturetechfam A17 #ParkChat I'd like to do kayaking in @PicturedRocksNL or Apostle Islands. Or rent a Jeep or other ""4-wheel drive"" vehicle to do the trails in @CanyonlandsNPS."
6638,CamaroWRX,"@59NationalParks @naturetechfam @AliceLFord A16 #ParkChat This needed a trigger warning. 

I would love to visit a park with my dad. Because I can't anymore."
6639,CamaroWRX,"@AliceLFord @59NationalParks @naturetechfam A15 #ParkChat Karen The Plogger. I can't help myself; if I have a bag with me, I will compulsively pick up trash along the trail."
6640,CamaroWRX,@ChrisRiefPhoto @AliceLFord @59NationalParks @naturetechfam I don't think so. :(
6641,CamaroWRX,"@naturetechfam @59NationalParks @AliceLFord A14 #ParkChat My own personal idea about the difference is that there is no difference, only people's expectations. @NewRiverNPS is more crowded as an NP than it was before. &lt;sigh&gt;"
6642,CamaroWRX,"@RCGibby73 @AliceLFord @59NationalParks @naturetechfam I wanted to go there when my husband diverted us into NM from Canyonlands! The ladybugs are there! (I've been there before, but he hasn't). #ParkChat"
6643,CamaroWRX,"@AliceLFord @59NationalParks @naturetechfam A13 #ParkChat I am going to say it and take flak for it, but Yellowstone. It's cool and all, but yeah, it literally stinks of sulphur and there are too many people."
6644,CamaroWRX,"@59NationalParks @naturetechfam @AliceLFord A12 #ParkChat I'm probably stealing @naturetechfam's answer, but the Black Hills NF/Buffalo Gap NG is the BEST gateway for a National Park (@BadlandsNPS and @WindCaveNPS), since you have both a Forest and a Grassland and two NPs and Jewel Cave and Custer SP.... yeah."

If so, a bison in @WindCaveNPS. And I'd want to know all about their history and how they interact with their people (Lakota)."
6648,CamaroWRX,"@louisbink @AliceLFord @59NationalParks @naturetechfam This has a strong ""Night at the Museum"" feel. #ParkChat"
6649,CamaroWRX,"@59NationalParks @naturetechfam @AliceLFord A8 #ParkChat I'm not sure how to answer this, since I'm not so focused on the entry as much as I'm concerned about the park. Maybe Front Royal for @ShenandoahNPS? It's a smallish town for Virginia, but has all of the amenities you'd need!"
6650,CamaroWRX,"@tthrash Yeah, and now you know my pain from the past three weeks while I was on the road trip (plus the time zone issues!!). I did a lot of speech-to-text. #ParkChat"

6655,CamaroWRX,"@59NationalParks @naturetechfam @AliceLFord A4 #ParkChat I would certainly choose my own two feet. Most of my time in public lands has been on my feet. I don't mind biking or riding a horse, but I feel I see so much more when I'm on the ground myself. https://t.co/qcuuSUZJZR"
6656,CamaroWRX,@AliceLFord @59NationalParks @naturetechfam A3 #ParkChat Eesh.... I'm not sure if I can think of anything that qualifies. I probably have it blocked from my memory! I'll add to this if I remember something.

7804,sally_hines,"@JeanHatchet I think you have a reductive understanding of left and right. Many socialists, of course, have had/continue to have very problematic views around gender, race, sexuality‚Ä¶"
7805,sally_hines,"@JeanHatchet Oh Jean, you can accuse me of many a thing but never of trying to turn a lesbian woman straight."
7806,sally_hines,@JeanHatchet But it is and it is
7807,sally_hines,"The shift away from thinking about gender critical ideology solely as representative of a split within UK feminism is vital to theorising it as key to a broader racist, patriarchal, ableist and heteronormative project. #IDAHOTForum2022"
7808,sally_hines,"The understanding of gender critical thinking as an intrinsic element in a European anti-gender movement that aligns with the far right is importantly gaining ground in broader activist, policy and political arenas. #IDAHOTForum2022"

7830,sally_hines,@ReaditPickles It‚Äôs not really trans specific. I didn‚Äôt set out to do a PhD ‚Äòon trans‚Äô. But anyway‚Ä¶ Yes things are really shit. Though even 20 years ago it was never easy. Pressure to publish existed then and dire job market. The identity of ECR didn‚Äôt exist then either
7831,sally_hines,@RozKaveney Thank you for being the person I found.
7832,sally_hines,@4_emmap So glad you think that cos you‚Äôre next! üë©‚Äçüéì
7833,sally_hines,"Oh well. Hey ho. And anyway, they really wouldn‚Äôt have suited a gimp mask."
7834,sally_hines,"Bea and I don‚Äôt agree now but as a writer she was a role model once upon a time - and Suzanne Moore, Deborah Orr‚Ä¶ Even Julie Burchill! And then, to me, they shape shifted. They became the very subjects of their earlier critiques."
7835,sally_hines,Questionable (from my perspective) feminists have always existed. I stopped being confused about this as a teenager when I read Andrea Dworkins Right Wing Women and Bea Cambells book on Tory women whose title that I forget.
7836,sally_hines,@RozKaveney The older I get the more I think about those meetings. I found them in City Limits and came on my own. I was just 20.
7837,sally_hines,I‚Äôll never forget the coat hanger. And I‚Äôll always connect the coat hanger to the manipulation of fear around gender difference. Bad blood. But I‚Äôll always think about joy. And hope. And the promise of a better gendered life. Good blood.
7838,sally_hines,It all started as a kid when I asked my step mum why that magazine had a coat hanger dripping with blood on its front cover - and why did it have such a weird name (Spare Rib). And all these decades later and I‚Äôm worrying again about the coat hanger.
7839,sally_hines,"These days I want to do all I can to ensure that trans researchers get to work on trans. My job is to move over. I don‚Äôt think that I became a professor because of doing work on trans so early, though it certainly helped."
7840,sally_hines,"These projects weren‚Äôt ‚Äòsupported‚Äô by trans researchers, they were made by them. And while I always strive to assist them to build their careers through  for instance named publications, grant writing support, I, of course. benefit the most. I get promoted. Invited. Named."
7841,sally_hines,"The institution were excited-cutting edge, newsworthy, perfect for EDI auditing. It was an absolute no from me. Never. The success of my trans‚Äô projects were all because of the trans researchers - the wonderful @NotRightRuth for example."
7842,sally_hines,I‚Äôd built up community relationships. I costed in activist groups as consultants. I employed trans and queer women. But it started to feel different. On getting my professorship it was assumed by the panel that I would become Professor of Transgender Studies.
7843,sally_hines,I began to work on citizenship and critiques of rights based politics. I found I loved writing and began to get published (a lot!) I won more bids. Was invited to events. Got promoted. I had a profile. I was a cis woman. I was working on trans.
7844,sally_hines,"I did talk about my positionality but briefly and in what I now think was a very weak way. It was 2004, the GRA had passed. I got funding to look at the GRA. On this project I began to think a lot about doing the work as a cis woman."
7845,sally_hines,Still no one raised my being cis. Other people in gender studies and sociology began to focus on trans issues in PhDs. My amazing friend @zowiedavy who I began to have this - and so many more - conversation with. I finished my PhD and wrote my first book.
7846,sally_hines,People with so much joy and With significant trauma and mental health issues. So many people wanted to talk. For hours. There were so many more people I couldn‚Äôt interview. Something was shifting. Nadia had won Big Brother. People wanted to talk. And be heard.
7847,sally_hines,"I stayed for hours. For dinner. Into the evenings. I was doing repeat interviews so back I went. For almost a year. I also spoke to women who were more familiar to me, lesbian trans women, musicians, performers. And bus drivers and women without jobs."
7848,sally_hines,I‚Äôd never spoke to a straight trans women before. Women who lived and loved their wives of decades but were definite they weren‚Äôt lesbian. Women who desired and were desired by straight men. Women whose politics were so different to mine. I didn‚Äôt know any Tories or even Liberals
7849,sally_hines,"‚ÄòReal life test‚Äô, public outings and job losses, loosing family and children. Violence. Abuse. Stigma. Shame. This was miles away from Chain Reaction. And I went to meetings and conferences - GENDES. Voice workshops. Discos. Ball gowns. Fancy hair and even fancier make up"
7850,sally_hines,But it worked. It was *all* about self determination and bodily autonomy. And i began to think about legal and medical practices - institutional regulation. I knew about the politics of performance and gender subversion. I went on to learn so much more.
7851,sally_hines,"Risk assessments didn‚Äôt exist and I travelled around the UK on the train alone, went to peoples houses. Met in bars or cafes. I interviewed 50 people-trans men and women. I‚Äôd go from an interview with a Drag King in Highgate one day to a country conservative councillor the next."
7852,sally_hines,My plan was around subversive genders - it was about the London stuff.  For funding I had to broaden it out and it came to include trans women. I didn‚Äôt think about being cis. No one asked me - until much later - about being cis. It‚Äôs unreal to think that now.
7853,sally_hines,I had a baby. Moved from London. Taught in Adult Ed and FE. I‚Äôd done a year of a part time self funded PhD in London - young women and rave. Left it to earn as a mum. Always had doing a PhD sitting in my head. And I met the perfect person at the right time and amazingly got funds
7854,sally_hines,"Women around me began social transitioning. My ex‚Äôs traumas made sense. Communities began to be formed. FtM London, Del ‚Äòs photos, Jack‚Äôs and Jay‚Äôs books. Stephen and Press for Change."
7855,sally_hines,"Coming from Greenham, this ‚Äòscene‚Äô made sense. I knew it‚Äôs people. It was as it had been. As it should be. Remaking gender. Twisting - and being twisted by - sex. Forging a different future."
7856,sally_hines,"I joined Feminist Against Censorship, recently formed by @RozKaveney I was the youngest and I was shy-I think for the first time in my life. I didn‚Äôt say much but I loved it. I was in awe. This was the early 1990s. Battles were about porn, leather. BDSM and body mod. Butch/femme"
7857,sally_hines,"Lesbians hadn‚Äôt, in our lives, had sex in public, role played, performed. Performance was central. Politics of performance and rebellion. Politics of filth. And it was creative and so very funny. Smart. So I went out a lot. Going out, dressing up, acting out, was our politics."
7858,sally_hines,"It was also brilliant fun. For me as a young woman new to London to start a degree. Living with my partner who was trans before we knew that was different from Stone. Before we knew how to really think about it. Still, we were young. The clubs were raucous, so sexy. Outrageous."
7859,sally_hines,"Politics of the body and sexuality were central as now in the terf wars. Attempts by some feminists to police that which they saw as undesirable, perverted, in others. Battles raged. In lesbian community centres, bars, clubs. It was vicious."
7860,sally_hines,And of course there was @stephenwhittle and @susanstryker Mine was about social movements and gender diverse (sub)cultures. A big focus was the relationship between feminism and trans. This way preceded terfism and linked to its forerunner the sex wars.
7861,sally_hines,It also looked at communities of care. There were three other UK sociologists doing related work/Richard Ekins and Dave King‚Äôs joint work and @SuryaMonro5432 who had started her PhD a year before. Surya‚Äôs work was more policy focused than mine. Ekins and King‚Äôs more typography.
